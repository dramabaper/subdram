00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:10.441
(Episode 31)

2
00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:12.381
Hello, sir.

3
00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:23.195
- Arrest him. - Pardon?

4
00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:25.096
I said, "arrest him".

5
00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:32.206
You're a fake.

6
00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:41.086
(2007 Odong Blowfish House Murder)

7
00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:42.245
Am I wrong?

8
00:00:43.086 --> 00:00:44.115
Kim Jong Sam?

9
00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:54.325
(Background Check Results)

10
00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:01.336
(Name: Oh Il Seung)

11
00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:02.865
Jin Jin Young.

12
00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:05.435
Handcuff him.

13
00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:08.946
I said, "handcuff him".

14
00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:17.916
What are you doing?

15
00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:19.616
Aren't you going to arrest him?

16
00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:22.256
Should I arrest him instead?

17
00:01:26.196 --> 00:01:28.066
I heard you arrested Chairwoman Gook Su Ran.

18
00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:36.735
What's with the ambiance?

19
00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:40.205
You guys should be celebrating right now.

20
00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:46.985
Hey.

21
00:01:52.086 --> 00:01:54.355
I guess he got caught after all.

22
00:01:56.586 --> 00:01:58.495
I heard you were on the Odong Blowfish House Murder case,

23
00:01:58.495 --> 00:02:00.765
so I figured he wouldn't be able to hide for much longer.

24
00:02:01.765 --> 00:02:05.336
I knew he'd get caught soon since you're pretty quick-witted.

25
00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:08.006
But you found out faster than I thought you would.

26
00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:09.105
What do you mean?

27
00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:12.006
Are you saying you already knew about this?

28
00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:14.275
He impersonated a police officer. It's a crime.

29
00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:16.916
So?

30
00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:18.846
Are you going to arrest him?

31
00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:21.316
You won't be able to.

32
00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:24.656
I couldn't arrest him even when I knew everything.

33
00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:28.955
The documents clearly state that he's Oh Il Seung.

34
00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:30.696
Then are you going to let him keep doing this?

35
00:02:32.455 --> 00:02:35.166
That's actually up to you.

36
00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:40.235
But if you want to prove that Oh Il Seung is Kim Jong Sam,

37
00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:42.105
you'll have to go after...

38
00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:45.105
both the NIS and Lee Kwang Ho since they were actually behind this.

39
00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:47.406
But the problem is,

40
00:02:48.446 --> 00:02:52.476
no matter how much you did, you won't find a thing.

41
00:02:57.085 --> 00:02:59.055
You can arrest Kim Jong Sam...

42
00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:01.726
after you arrest Lee Kwang Ho.

43
00:03:02.525 --> 00:03:04.455
So don't waste your energy,

44
00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:08.066
and just give me Chairwoman Gook.

45
00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:15.105
Where are you going?

46
00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:19.006
- I'm running away. - That won't solve anything.

47
00:03:19.205 --> 00:03:21.376
You should be begging or asking Inspector Park to...

48
00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:23.775
Do you think that's going to solve anything?

49
00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:27.746
You know Inspector Park. He'll never forgive me.

50
00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:32.115
I feel sorry for what I did,

51
00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:35.186
and I'm ashamed to face him.

52
00:03:36.825 --> 00:03:39.355
I'm sorry for making you get involved in this.

53
00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:42.166
Forget it. Don't apologize.

54
00:03:44.096 --> 00:03:46.436
You should go inside. You have a lot of work to do.

55
00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:49.536
Do you think Inspector Park told Prosecutor Kim?

56
00:03:51.175 --> 00:03:52.376
It doesn't matter.

57
00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:55.906
- He already knows. - He does?

58
00:03:56.705 --> 00:03:58.075
And he still let go of it?

59
00:04:00.545 --> 00:04:02.286
Because everything's perfect on paper.

60
00:04:06.786 --> 00:04:08.126
What are you going to do now?

61
00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:11.996
I should run away.

62
00:04:13.425 --> 00:04:14.925
I also have something I need to look into.

63
00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:16.496
Don't go too far.

64
00:04:17.796 --> 00:04:19.535
I'm sure we can come up with a way.

65
00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:21.405
Okay.

66
00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:24.806
Bye.

67
00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:47.366
(11:08pm: Covered up Lee Kwang Ho and Gook Su Ran's murder scene)

68
00:04:52.496 --> 00:04:53.535
Did...

69
00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:55.806
Lee Kwang Ho kill Ms. Hong?

70
00:04:57.475 --> 00:04:58.506
What if he did?

71
00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.006
Then we need to catch him.

72
00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:03.876
It doesn't matter whether it was you or Lee Kwang Ho.

73
00:05:04.316 --> 00:05:06.746
The weapon used to kill Prosecutor Joo was found,

74
00:05:07.946 --> 00:05:09.645
so I'm sure there will be some kind of evidence...

75
00:05:10.215 --> 00:05:11.585
to prove that he killed Ms. Hong.

76
00:05:22.465 --> 00:05:25.965
(11:08pm: Covered up Lee Kwang Ho and Gook Su Ran's murder scene)

77
00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:30.205
- Who wrote this? - Mr. Cha.

78
00:05:32.535 --> 00:05:34.975
So you need to go outside and find him first.

79
00:05:36.246 --> 00:05:38.475
I'm sure he'll have at least one more evidence...

80
00:05:38.676 --> 00:05:41.715
to prove that Lee Kwang Ho is guilty of murder.

81
00:05:44.085 --> 00:05:46.515
- Are you telling the truth? - Don't you get it yet?

82
00:05:47.455 --> 00:05:50.356
Don't you understand that I'm trying to help you?

83
00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:56.566
(11:08pm: Covered up Lee Kwang Ho and Gook Su Ran's murder scene)

84
00:05:59.296 --> 00:06:01.535
Lee Kwang Ho and Gook Su Ran.

85
00:06:08.645 --> 00:06:10.176
11:08pm.

86
00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:13.046
Covered up Lee Kwang Ho and Gook Su Ran's...

87
00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.145
murder scene.

88
00:06:28.796 --> 00:06:29.796
Jong Sam.

89
00:06:33.606 --> 00:06:35.205
- What's wrong? - This is the police.

90
00:06:35.705 --> 00:06:36.936
Open up.

91
00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:51.386
(11:08pm: Covered up Lee Kwang Ho and Gook Su Ran's murder scene)

92
00:06:55.126 --> 00:06:58.455
How am I going to find Mr. Cha?

93
00:07:07.136 --> 00:07:09.136
Long time no see, Mr. Cha.

94
00:07:17.845 --> 00:07:18.876
Sir.

95
00:07:19.515 --> 00:07:20.715
Yes.

96
00:07:22.486 --> 00:07:23.955
Do you recognize me?

97
00:07:28.085 --> 00:07:29.556
I don't know what you mean, sir.

98
00:07:30.756 --> 00:07:32.296
I saw you this morning.

99
00:07:33.426 --> 00:07:34.465
He has Alzheimer's.

100
00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:37.395
It seems as if he can only remember bits and pieces of the past.

101
00:07:39.296 --> 00:07:40.335
Goodness.

102
00:07:42.465 --> 00:07:44.205
You have a guest.

103
00:07:45.905 --> 00:07:47.946
I'll leave you two alone, sir.

104
00:07:48.205 --> 00:07:49.246
It's okay.

105
00:07:50.145 --> 00:07:51.316
Stay there.

106
00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:52.645
Pardon?

107
00:07:57.986 --> 00:08:00.455
Is that all? Anything else?

108
00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:01.856
No.

109
00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:04.756
If I hadn't gotten to him first,

110
00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:08.895
the Hidden Crime Team would've found him, and you...

111
00:08:08.895 --> 00:08:10.095
And what?

112
00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:12.595
What?

113
00:08:13.236 --> 00:08:16.665
Do you think there's evidence that could nail me?

114
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.405
I didn't mean that.

115
00:08:18.405 --> 00:08:20.106
There is nothing like that.

116
00:08:20.645 --> 00:08:23.746
I have nothing to do with the Odong Blowfish House.

117
00:08:24.876 --> 00:08:25.915
Yes, sir.

118
00:08:26.676 --> 00:08:27.746
You may leave.

119
00:08:28.785 --> 00:08:31.515
Where should I take him?

120
00:08:33.086 --> 00:08:35.126
Take him to where he was supposed to go.

121
00:08:35.685 --> 00:08:37.525
I should've sent him there 10 years ago.

122
00:08:38.295 --> 00:08:40.596
Chairwoman Gook made a mistake because she wasn't tough enough.

123
00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.626
Yes, sir.

124
00:08:51.905 --> 00:08:53.236
I guess you aren't happy to see me.

125
00:08:54.606 --> 00:08:56.405
But I'm a bit happy to see you.

126
00:08:58.415 --> 00:09:01.386
Chairwoman Gook has been arrested. Did you know about that?

127
00:09:03.116 --> 00:09:05.616
Of course. She got arrested on his orders.

128
00:09:07.685 --> 00:09:09.986
Is it okay to let her be arrested?

129
00:09:11.025 --> 00:09:12.756
She has been a very close acquaintance...

130
00:09:12.756 --> 00:09:15.226
Don't worry. She knows a lot,

131
00:09:15.866 --> 00:09:17.136
but she has no evidence.

132
00:09:17.136 --> 00:09:18.866
She won't be able to say anything.

133
00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:21.706
Because it'll be like spitting on her own face.

134
00:09:27.576 --> 00:09:29.976
Who is this man?

135
00:09:35.315 --> 00:09:39.356
What's shocking is that Mr. Cha is still alive.

136
00:09:39.716 --> 00:09:41.256
The chairwoman kept him alive.

137
00:09:41.326 --> 00:09:43.726
So the chairwoman has been arrested.

138
00:09:43.795 --> 00:09:44.856
For real?

139
00:09:46.395 --> 00:09:48.466
Of course you don't know about Mr. Cha.

140
00:09:48.826 --> 00:09:50.435
Yes, the chairwoman was arrested.

141
00:09:50.966 --> 00:09:53.805
She called me to hire a lawyer.

142
00:09:53.805 --> 00:09:56.136
Why don't you contact Attorney An then?

143
00:09:56.405 --> 00:09:59.376
She wants someone other than Attorney An.

144
00:09:59.535 --> 00:10:00.846
Wait a minute.

145
00:10:01.305 --> 00:10:03.376
What's going on right now?

146
00:10:04.576 --> 00:10:06.915
Manager Lee and Chairwoman Gook split up.

147
00:10:07.015 --> 00:10:08.285
How did you find out?

148
00:10:09.185 --> 00:10:10.616
You have to keep this a secret.

149
00:10:11.155 --> 00:10:13.356
Manager Lee ordered me to tail her...

150
00:10:13.356 --> 00:10:14.856
and report her moves to him.

151
00:10:14.856 --> 00:10:17.055
Oh, my goodness.

152
00:10:17.996 --> 00:10:19.096
Did you do it?

153
00:10:19.096 --> 00:10:20.425
No, I couldn't.

154
00:10:20.996 --> 00:10:22.496
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

155
00:10:24.596 --> 00:10:28.106
She stabbed him in the back before I did anything.

156
00:10:28.836 --> 00:10:31.175
I should've looked after the chairwoman...

157
00:10:32.076 --> 00:10:34.106
instead of chasing after Jang Pil Sung.

158
00:10:34.346 --> 00:10:37.645
So is Jang Pil Sung in Manager Lee's house?

159
00:10:37.746 --> 00:10:40.785
Yes. I believe the guy we saved is...

160
00:10:40.785 --> 00:10:43.015
pledging his allegiance to Manager Lee.

161
00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:44.285
Gosh.

162
00:10:45.586 --> 00:10:47.456
What do we do now?

163
00:10:47.486 --> 00:10:49.425
There's really no answer to that.

164
00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:52.695
It doesn't feel right to be on Manager Lee's side.

165
00:10:52.956 --> 00:10:56.425
But if I side with the chairwoman, my life will be in trouble.

166
00:10:58.435 --> 00:10:59.736
I want to emigrate.

167
00:11:00.606 --> 00:11:02.165
Take me with you if you do.

168
00:11:04.535 --> 00:11:05.606
Sir.

169
00:11:13.645 --> 00:11:14.645
What should we do?

170
00:11:15.185 --> 00:11:17.285
What can we do? Let's just follow them.

171
00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:18.415
Okay.

172
00:11:35.035 --> 00:11:38.576
I got this security footage from an asylum.

173
00:11:39.076 --> 00:11:40.076
Here.

174
00:11:40.846 --> 00:11:44.616
This man is Mr. Cha who had been in there for 10 years.

175
00:11:45.015 --> 00:11:46.346
His name is Cha Gwang Tae.

176
00:11:46.616 --> 00:11:49.716
Next to him is Jang Pil Sung.

177
00:11:49.716 --> 00:11:52.616
He's really alive. He's perfectly fine.

178
00:11:53.256 --> 00:11:54.626
He really is alive.

179
00:11:54.856 --> 00:11:58.025
He took Mr. Cha before we got there.

180
00:11:58.025 --> 00:12:00.165
So Chairwoman Gook...

181
00:12:00.226 --> 00:12:03.395
went there to meet Mr. Cha and got caught.

182
00:12:03.596 --> 00:12:06.636
Then why was the Odong Blowfish House evidence...

183
00:12:06.905 --> 00:12:08.305
there?

184
00:12:08.435 --> 00:12:12.035
It seems that Jang Pil Sung put it there.

185
00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:14.405
Looking at Gook Su Ran's GPS history,

186
00:12:14.405 --> 00:12:16.945
you know she has visited the asylum before.

187
00:12:17.746 --> 00:12:20.986
She would've gotten rid of the evidence if she had known.

188
00:12:21.086 --> 00:12:23.915
He didn't put it there, he left it there.

189
00:12:23.986 --> 00:12:28.486
Anyway, that means Jang Pil Sung turned on Gook Su Ran.

190
00:12:28.685 --> 00:12:31.055
Why did he turn on her when she was the one...

191
00:12:31.226 --> 00:12:33.025
who saved him?

192
00:12:33.596 --> 00:12:36.836
Lee Kwang Ho and Jang Pil Sung must be on the same side.

193
00:12:36.836 --> 00:12:38.496
That's very likely.

194
00:12:40.466 --> 00:12:42.206
Mr. Cha will be in danger.

195
00:12:42.435 --> 00:12:44.805
The one who had been cleaning after Lee Kwang Ho...

196
00:12:44.836 --> 00:12:48.106
has kept the evidence for 10 years.

197
00:12:49.576 --> 00:12:51.076
Even if he has Alzheimer's,

198
00:12:51.775 --> 00:12:54.086
they would be nervous that he had more evidence.

199
00:12:54.886 --> 00:12:58.116
Min Pyo and Dae Woong. Find where Lee Kwang Ho is.

200
00:12:58.116 --> 00:12:59.616
Get ready to go undercover.

201
00:12:59.616 --> 00:13:02.086
Get Jang Pil Sung's plate number, and put him on the wanted list.

202
00:13:02.256 --> 00:13:03.256
Yes, sir.

203
00:13:03.496 --> 00:13:06.096
By the way, where is Officer Oh?

204
00:13:06.096 --> 00:13:08.065
He's on vacation. He had some things to take care of.

205
00:13:08.195 --> 00:13:09.226
Get going.

206
00:13:09.226 --> 00:13:10.295
Okay.

207
00:13:15.665 --> 00:13:18.405
- Inspector Park. - Don't say anything.

208
00:13:19.136 --> 00:13:21.545
If you do, you'd be admitting yourself as an accomplice.

209
00:13:22.846 --> 00:13:24.076
So stay quiet.

210
00:13:25.945 --> 00:13:27.616
Go find Jang Pil Sung's car.

211
00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:30.785
Go.

212
00:13:33.116 --> 00:13:34.126
Yes, sir.

213
00:13:52.606 --> 00:13:53.606
Hi.

214
00:13:54.606 --> 00:13:56.445
I think Mr. Cha is in danger.

215
00:13:56.675 --> 00:13:59.846
The security footage showed that Jang Pil Sung took Mr. Cha.

216
00:14:00.945 --> 00:14:02.086
Jang Pil Sung took him?

217
00:14:03.415 --> 00:14:06.256
Then Jang Pil Sung and Lee Kwang Ho are on the same boat.

218
00:14:08.386 --> 00:14:12.456
Can you let me know when you find Mr. Cha?

219
00:14:12.555 --> 00:14:13.996
Okay, I will.

220
00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:17.136
Thanks. We'll talk again.

221
00:14:17.966 --> 00:14:19.096
Bye.

222
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.120
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E31 Doubtful Victory "You're a Fake"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

223
00:14:35.386 --> 00:14:36.856
(11:08pm: Covered up Lee Kwang Ho and Gook Su Ran's murder scene)

224
00:14:40.525 --> 00:14:44.295
It's good that we know at least some parts of what happened.

225
00:14:46.226 --> 00:14:48.866
According to what's written there,

226
00:14:49.726 --> 00:14:51.665
Mr. Cha killed Ms. Hong.

227
00:14:58.006 --> 00:15:00.645
But Su Ran said, Lee Kwang Ho...

228
00:15:00.706 --> 00:15:04.015
strangled Ms. Hong. So he's guilty of attempted murder.

229
00:15:06.815 --> 00:15:09.685
We could've done something if we had Ms. Hong's clipped nails.

230
00:15:09.685 --> 00:15:12.785
Jang Pil Sung would've gotten rid of them if we had them.

231
00:15:12.915 --> 00:15:16.726
By the way, why did Lee Kwang Ho try to kill Ms. Hong?

232
00:15:17.655 --> 00:15:18.726
I'm not sure.

233
00:15:27.236 --> 00:15:29.136
Mr. Cha's name is Cha Gwang Tae.

234
00:15:31.175 --> 00:15:32.206
All right.

235
00:15:33.136 --> 00:15:36.476
Why are you out here alone and not with your team?

236
00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:39.445
Inspector Park caught me.

237
00:15:40.015 --> 00:15:41.216
So I ran away.

238
00:15:43.315 --> 00:15:44.815
You lasted longer than I expected.

239
00:15:46.515 --> 00:15:49.785
I know Inspector Park wouldn't let it slide.

240
00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:52.826
So,

241
00:15:53.866 --> 00:15:55.425
will you operate on your own?

242
00:15:56.065 --> 00:15:58.665
Yes. I'll visit Chairwoman Gook again.

243
00:16:01.136 --> 00:16:03.836
Hey. Take the car.

244
00:16:04.606 --> 00:16:06.175
Are you going somewhere?

245
00:16:06.336 --> 00:16:07.645
There's someone I must meet.

246
00:16:21.326 --> 00:16:22.785
Chairwoman Gook.

247
00:16:23.655 --> 00:16:28.366
I said I'd be very accommodating.

248
00:16:28.866 --> 00:16:31.336
You have to go to jail anyway.

249
00:16:31.565 --> 00:16:34.506
It'd be unfair to go alone.

250
00:16:34.665 --> 00:16:37.636
So you should take Manager Lee with you.

251
00:16:39.206 --> 00:16:42.506
You need to give me something, so I can start digging.

252
00:16:42.675 --> 00:16:45.116
If you keep your mouth shut like that...

253
00:16:49.915 --> 00:16:54.025
Goodness. It's the fugitive, Officer Oh.

254
00:16:55.386 --> 00:16:57.996
I have to talk to Chairwoman Gook.

255
00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:00.966
Could you please give us time to talk?

256
00:17:03.996 --> 00:17:05.096
Well, I'm sorry.

257
00:17:06.036 --> 00:17:09.905
Chairwoman Gook has her mouth shut,

258
00:17:10.005 --> 00:17:11.475
so even if I let you...

259
00:17:11.475 --> 00:17:12.776
I need to talk to him.

260
00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:17.145
Could you please leave the room?

261
00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:19.245
I can't believe this.

262
00:17:20.016 --> 00:17:23.346
I've met a lot of suspects before,

263
00:17:23.346 --> 00:17:28.225
but I've never met one who made me feel left out.

264
00:17:29.586 --> 00:17:31.326
It's really upsetting.

265
00:17:32.255 --> 00:17:33.455
It won't take long.

266
00:17:42.465 --> 00:17:43.806
You're going to tell me...

267
00:17:44.336 --> 00:17:46.005
what you talked about with her...

268
00:17:46.005 --> 00:17:49.306
before you leave, right?

269
00:17:49.776 --> 00:17:52.175
If you leave me out of my case so obviously like this,

270
00:17:52.376 --> 00:17:53.915
I might become a little twisted.

271
00:18:03.755 --> 00:18:06.056
- Did you find Mr. Cha? - I'm looking for him.

272
00:18:06.965 --> 00:18:07.965
Why did...

273
00:18:08.596 --> 00:18:11.366
Lee Kwang Ho choke Ms. Hong?

274
00:18:17.235 --> 00:18:19.876
(Odong Blowfish House)

275
00:18:53.776 --> 00:18:54.905
This restaurant...

276
00:18:55.876 --> 00:18:57.415
has the best barley tea.

277
00:18:57.616 --> 00:18:58.846
I'm disappointed.

278
00:18:59.445 --> 00:19:02.046
You're complimenting barley tea at a blowfish restaurant.

279
00:19:04.715 --> 00:19:07.326
What did you do with Jin Jung Gil?

280
00:19:09.155 --> 00:19:11.495
Ms. Hong, do you know how...

281
00:19:11.695 --> 00:19:13.495
I managed to come this far?

282
00:19:14.066 --> 00:19:15.266
It was thanks to my guts.

283
00:19:16.626 --> 00:19:20.435
I can guess beforehand if someone's trying to betray me or not.

284
00:19:21.606 --> 00:19:25.136
My gut feelings were never wrong, and I just got that feeling.

285
00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:29.175
What did you do?

286
00:19:30.046 --> 00:19:31.445
I gave him a weapon...

287
00:19:32.415 --> 00:19:33.685
that can destroy you.

288
00:19:36.445 --> 00:19:38.215
I don't think a murderer like you...

289
00:19:39.316 --> 00:19:41.755
should become the president.

290
00:19:57.076 --> 00:19:59.076
If she found out about something she shouldn't have,

291
00:20:00.776 --> 00:20:02.505
the least she could do was to stay quiet.

292
00:20:07.116 --> 00:20:10.155
You don't know why he tried to kill her?

293
00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:11.985
If I were to guess,

294
00:20:12.455 --> 00:20:14.255
it was probably because of Chairman Jin.

295
00:20:15.056 --> 00:20:18.526
Ms. Hong was the one who gave Chairman Jin the recorded file.

296
00:20:20.096 --> 00:20:21.925
Are you talking about the recorder that...

297
00:20:22.366 --> 00:20:25.636
Chairman Jin had brought from the restaurant before he died?

298
00:20:28.465 --> 00:20:30.106
What was recorded in that file?

299
00:20:31.306 --> 00:20:32.435
I'm not sure.

300
00:20:33.806 --> 00:20:36.505
Ms. Hong had recorded it a long time ago.

301
00:20:37.346 --> 00:20:39.376
And it had conversations about Lee Kwang Ho's...

302
00:20:40.046 --> 00:20:41.116
personal life.

303
00:20:42.086 --> 00:20:43.715
Then I guess that specific conversation...

304
00:20:44.316 --> 00:20:46.016
was his weakness...

305
00:20:47.326 --> 00:20:51.955
since he was desperate enough to choke Ms. Hong himself.

306
00:20:53.425 --> 00:20:55.296
I guess you believe me now.

307
00:20:55.895 --> 00:20:58.336
No, I don't believe you.

308
00:20:59.036 --> 00:21:01.366
I'm just taking my chances whether or not it's true.

309
00:21:01.366 --> 00:21:03.106
If it's going to help me catch Lee Kwang Ho,

310
00:21:04.136 --> 00:21:06.806
I'll even listen to the most ridiculous stories if I have to.

311
00:21:09.905 --> 00:21:11.616
How much does Mr. Cha know?

312
00:21:11.616 --> 00:21:14.185
He doesn't know much since he has Alzheimer's.

313
00:21:14.516 --> 00:21:15.546
But...

314
00:21:16.116 --> 00:21:18.286
he probably has a record of...

315
00:21:19.116 --> 00:21:22.026
everything that Lee Kwang Ho had ever asked him to do.

316
00:21:23.326 --> 00:21:25.596
Then Jang Pil Sung probably already took everything...

317
00:21:26.096 --> 00:21:29.965
since he was the one who took Mr. Cha from the hospital.

318
00:21:30.695 --> 00:21:31.836
No.

319
00:21:32.766 --> 00:21:34.566
I'm sure he didn't keep it in his hospital room.

320
00:21:35.165 --> 00:21:36.935
He probably either hid it somewhere...

321
00:21:37.306 --> 00:21:39.336
or gave it to someone he could fully trust.

322
00:21:41.376 --> 00:21:43.616
If Jang Pil Sung came across it,

323
00:21:44.145 --> 00:21:46.376
he would've betrayed Lee Kwang Ho already.

324
00:21:47.185 --> 00:21:49.145
If he got his hands on something so huge,

325
00:21:49.145 --> 00:21:53.725
he wouldn't want to stay by Lee Kwang Ho's side.

326
00:22:02.126 --> 00:22:05.695
I gave you a bit more time than you asked for, didn't I?

327
00:22:08.905 --> 00:22:11.576
Now, it's time for you to talk to me.

328
00:22:17.675 --> 00:22:18.715
I'll be off now.

329
00:22:19.816 --> 00:22:22.586
I warned you that I'm going to become twisted.

330
00:22:28.225 --> 00:22:30.826
- One bottle of soju, please. - Okay.

331
00:22:32.796 --> 00:22:33.895
That was delicious.

332
00:22:35.195 --> 00:22:38.366
We're done eating, so tell me. Why did you want to meet?

333
00:22:42.505 --> 00:22:43.505
Kim Jong Sam.

334
00:22:46.036 --> 00:22:47.445
I knew it.

335
00:22:48.745 --> 00:22:49.745
Why?

336
00:22:50.245 --> 00:22:52.116
He passed the police exam,

337
00:22:52.975 --> 00:22:55.485
and he would've been a great cop if he didn't get framed.

338
00:22:55.816 --> 00:22:56.856
I know.

339
00:22:57.415 --> 00:22:58.455
He's good with what he does.

340
00:23:00.086 --> 00:23:01.185
And he's a nice guy.

341
00:23:02.425 --> 00:23:03.495
So what?

342
00:23:03.495 --> 00:23:05.925
I think he's willing to take responsibility later,

343
00:23:06.126 --> 00:23:07.366
- so for now... - Chul Gi.

344
00:23:08.665 --> 00:23:10.336
Our job...

345
00:23:10.866 --> 00:23:13.336
is to arrest people.

346
00:23:13.935 --> 00:23:16.165
Try thinking of it in the shoes of the person who's getting arrested.

347
00:23:17.776 --> 00:23:19.475
They're both criminals.

348
00:23:19.475 --> 00:23:21.806
How would that criminal feel if he knew that the police officer...

349
00:23:22.546 --> 00:23:23.745
was a criminal as well?

350
00:23:24.616 --> 00:23:26.985
I know that our organization isn't perfect,

351
00:23:29.086 --> 00:23:31.886
but I still don't think this is right.

352
00:23:33.556 --> 00:23:34.626
Okay.

353
00:23:35.455 --> 00:23:39.556
But just know that if that cop didn't take his life away from him,

354
00:23:41.395 --> 00:23:42.495
he'd be...

355
00:23:43.326 --> 00:23:44.336
working with you...

356
00:23:44.766 --> 00:23:47.766
as a really good cop right now.

357
00:23:48.336 --> 00:23:51.376
I'm not telling you to turn a blind eye on him.

358
00:23:51.935 --> 00:23:53.806
I'm not asking you to accept him as your team member.

359
00:23:54.945 --> 00:23:56.705
I'm just asking you not to think of him as a sinner.

360
00:23:58.376 --> 00:23:59.715
That's why I asked you to meet.

361
00:24:07.356 --> 00:24:09.856
(Hangang Hospital)

362
00:24:18.336 --> 00:24:20.435
He probably has a record of...

363
00:24:20.735 --> 00:24:24.106
everything that Lee Kwang Ho had ever asked him to do.

364
00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:26.846
I'm sure he didn't keep it in his hospital room.

365
00:24:27.945 --> 00:24:29.705
He probably either hid it somewhere...

366
00:24:30.715 --> 00:24:32.776
or gave it to someone he could fully trust.

367
00:24:49.266 --> 00:24:50.296
Hey, it's me.

368
00:24:50.566 --> 00:24:52.096
You want a background check on Mr. Cha?

369
00:24:53.866 --> 00:24:56.036
I already looked into it, but there was nothing much.

370
00:24:56.566 --> 00:25:00.346
No one ever reported him missing even when he was gone for so long...

371
00:25:00.606 --> 00:25:02.346
because he doesn't have a family.

372
00:25:03.175 --> 00:25:04.245
Okay.

373
00:25:04.816 --> 00:25:06.415
I'll send you a photo of the file.

374
00:25:08.145 --> 00:25:09.715
Did you spend the night at the office?

375
00:25:11.356 --> 00:25:13.215
You should take care of yourself.

376
00:25:13.526 --> 00:25:16.485
Okay. You should do the same.

377
00:25:16.626 --> 00:25:19.026
You remember what I taught you, right?

378
00:25:20.695 --> 00:25:22.066
Use what you learned.

379
00:25:22.066 --> 00:25:23.536
Okay, I will.

380
00:25:24.695 --> 00:25:27.405
By the way, have you found...

381
00:25:27.766 --> 00:25:29.165
Jang Pil Sung and Mr. Cha yet?

382
00:25:37.445 --> 00:25:39.116
I need to go to the bathroom.

383
00:25:39.116 --> 00:25:43.415
My gosh, why do I need to do something like this?

384
00:25:43.655 --> 00:25:45.316
I should be the one driving.

385
00:25:46.586 --> 00:25:49.255
By the way, where are we going?

386
00:25:49.985 --> 00:25:52.596
We're going to where Manager Lee told me to take you.

387
00:25:52.596 --> 00:25:54.366
It's where you belong.

388
00:25:54.366 --> 00:25:55.596
Okay.

389
00:25:59.165 --> 00:26:00.505
Mr. Cha.

390
00:26:01.735 --> 00:26:04.935
Do you really have nothing more that you're hiding?

391
00:26:07.145 --> 00:26:08.675
Something really precious.

392
00:26:09.106 --> 00:26:10.445
Something that could...

393
00:26:11.046 --> 00:26:14.786
make Congressman Lee get in big trouble.

394
00:26:16.086 --> 00:26:18.056
Are you sure you're not hiding it somewhere?

395
00:26:19.816 --> 00:26:21.126
I gave it to someone.

396
00:26:21.425 --> 00:26:22.485
To whom?

397
00:26:24.326 --> 00:26:25.495
It's a secret.

398
00:26:26.526 --> 00:26:27.526
To that person.

399
00:26:29.326 --> 00:26:30.766
That person came to see me every day.

400
00:26:32.296 --> 00:26:33.965
So who exactly is that person?

401
00:26:35.066 --> 00:26:36.766
I need to go to the bathroom.

402
00:26:37.576 --> 00:26:40.076
- I really need to go. - My gosh, this man.

403
00:26:40.245 --> 00:26:41.475
Hurry up.

404
00:26:41.905 --> 00:26:43.675
You've been on my nerves ever since you got on the car.

405
00:26:43.675 --> 00:26:45.616
I'll be right back.

406
00:26:46.546 --> 00:26:50.485
I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

407
00:26:52.715 --> 00:26:53.755
What should we do?

408
00:26:54.755 --> 00:26:56.955
- Let's go get Mr. Cha. - Okay.

409
00:27:18.846 --> 00:27:19.945
Why did you follow me?

410
00:27:20.145 --> 00:27:21.215
Where do you think you're going?

411
00:27:21.415 --> 00:27:23.316
- Step aside. - Why should I?

412
00:27:23.346 --> 00:27:26.316
You don't want us to smash your pretty face, do you?

413
00:27:26.556 --> 00:27:28.556
We'll just take Mr. Cha quietly.

414
00:27:28.556 --> 00:27:30.796
If you want things to be quiet, just leave.

415
00:27:30.955 --> 00:27:32.755
I'm running errands for Manager Lee right now.

416
00:27:33.866 --> 00:27:36.266
You aren't going to turn on Manager Lee...

417
00:27:36.266 --> 00:27:38.536
and run amok like Chairwoman Gook, are you?

418
00:27:39.136 --> 00:27:40.306
Sir, he's gone.

419
00:27:40.405 --> 00:27:42.205
What do you mean? Find him.

420
00:27:42.205 --> 00:27:43.266
Yes, sir. Darn it.

421
00:27:46.005 --> 00:27:47.576
I'm at the right address.

422
00:27:48.306 --> 00:27:50.876
Yes. Black car? Okay.

423
00:27:52.876 --> 00:27:55.846
I found it! Thanks, Lieutenant Jin.

424
00:27:56.745 --> 00:28:00.326
Gosh, I can't believe it's them again.

425
00:28:00.425 --> 00:28:02.925
Hey, let's get Jang Pil Sung first.

426
00:28:09.465 --> 00:28:11.465
Have they all lost their minds?

427
00:28:15.036 --> 00:28:16.735
You should stop them, not me.

428
00:28:17.636 --> 00:28:20.036
If I get caught, Su Ran will be charged for...

429
00:28:20.036 --> 00:28:21.846
taking me out of the police.

430
00:28:22.505 --> 00:28:24.715
If I make an escape here,

431
00:28:25.215 --> 00:28:27.485
you can have Mr. Cha, so why would you stop me?

432
00:28:28.586 --> 00:28:30.955
Boy, am I happy to see you alive.

433
00:28:31.356 --> 00:28:32.356
What are you doing?

434
00:28:46.136 --> 00:28:50.276
Come on! I don't care about the NIS anymore.

435
00:28:56.505 --> 00:28:57.576
Sir!

436
00:28:59.016 --> 00:29:00.316
I'll take care of them.

437
00:29:07.856 --> 00:29:09.386
What's wrong with you guys?

438
00:29:10.725 --> 00:29:13.766
I don't care about being arrested. Just find Mr. Cha.

439
00:29:14.695 --> 00:29:16.665
Find him first.

440
00:29:30.145 --> 00:29:32.346
Mr. Cha disappeared.

441
00:29:37.556 --> 00:29:39.255
What other cards are there?

442
00:29:40.386 --> 00:29:43.526
Is there anything else that you hid?

443
00:29:44.326 --> 00:29:46.026
I gave it to someone.

444
00:29:47.395 --> 00:29:48.395
To whom?

445
00:29:50.126 --> 00:29:51.235
It's a secret.

446
00:29:52.336 --> 00:29:53.395
To that person.

447
00:29:54.366 --> 00:29:55.366
"That person"...

448
00:30:00.276 --> 00:30:01.505
Who could it be?

449
00:30:03.745 --> 00:30:05.316
(CT Scan Room)

450
00:30:20.056 --> 00:30:21.826
What I asked you earlier...

451
00:30:21.995 --> 00:30:24.935
Yes. I checked again.

452
00:30:25.796 --> 00:30:28.935
The hospital bill has been deposited regularly.

453
00:30:29.136 --> 00:30:32.276
There hadn't been any visitors except for the few recent ones.

454
00:30:32.905 --> 00:30:36.175
There's no record of belongings that has been checked in.

455
00:30:36.175 --> 00:30:38.046
Here. Take these.

456
00:30:41.245 --> 00:30:43.116
Where did you find these?

457
00:30:43.145 --> 00:30:44.516
They were in a bathroom closet.

458
00:30:45.215 --> 00:30:48.185
He had a habit of hiding stuff...

459
00:30:48.326 --> 00:30:50.126
in different places.

460
00:30:50.526 --> 00:30:52.725
Where did he usually hide things?

461
00:30:52.796 --> 00:30:54.566
The usual hiding spots were...

462
00:30:55.965 --> 00:30:59.395
fire hydrants, toilet tanks,

463
00:30:59.495 --> 00:31:03.005
laundry baskets, and under the beds.

464
00:31:06.306 --> 00:31:07.505
- Shoulders. - Shoulders.

465
00:31:08.145 --> 00:31:09.376
- Shoulders. - Shoulders.

466
00:31:10.046 --> 00:31:11.876
- Shoulders. The other way. - Shoulders.

467
00:31:11.876 --> 00:31:13.145
- Shoulders. - Shoulders.

468
00:31:13.786 --> 00:31:15.016
- Shoulders. - Shoulders.

469
00:31:15.645 --> 00:31:17.016
- Shoulders. - Shoulders.

470
00:31:17.485 --> 00:31:20.455
Spine. Stretch your spine. Good.

471
00:31:20.786 --> 00:31:23.386
Stretch it. The other way.

472
00:31:23.386 --> 00:31:24.695
Move it.

473
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:26.965
Good. Like you're going to fly away.

474
00:31:31.036 --> 00:31:32.036
Ma'am.

475
00:31:32.296 --> 00:31:33.395
Yes?

476
00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:35.705
- Could we talk for a minute? - Yes.

477
00:31:35.806 --> 00:31:36.876
Excuse me for a second.

478
00:31:39.735 --> 00:31:40.876
- Did... - Yes?

479
00:31:40.945 --> 00:31:43.816
Mr. Cha do anything daily?

480
00:31:43.876 --> 00:31:45.675
Daily? He prayed.

481
00:31:46.116 --> 00:31:47.915
He was a devout Christian.

482
00:31:49.046 --> 00:31:51.786
I didn't see a bible or a cross though.

483
00:31:51.856 --> 00:31:55.586
No? I don't think I saw any bible either.

484
00:31:55.586 --> 00:31:58.955
But there's a cross. He prayed in front of it every day.

485
00:31:59.026 --> 00:32:00.126
With me.

486
00:32:00.826 --> 00:32:02.225
- With you? - Yes.

487
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:06.449
(Episode 32 will air shortly.)
