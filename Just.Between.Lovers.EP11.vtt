00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.730 line:93%
Don't worry about him. He won't fall apart so easily like that.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.030 line:93%
My molars on this side are dental implants.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.710 line:93%
- They came loose when I was beaten.
- Pardon?

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.730 line:93%
Has it been ten years now?

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.670 line:93%
I've met a wrong man and was beaten to death.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.930 line:93%
I ran away because I was afraid I really was going to die.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:39.560 line:93%
When I was getting beat up by him, no one would stop him.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.550 line:93%
People only believed his words when he said I am a gold digger who fled with his money.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:49.180 line:93%
I thought I will die a horrible death here.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.680 line:93%
<i>Don't hit her.</i>

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.430 line:93%
A boy stood and yelled. Trembling in fear.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:08.110 line:93%
If you hit her again, I will hit you too, Mr.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.690 line:93%
I will hit you too, Mr.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:18.220 line:93%
That scrawny boy, against a man who is three times larger than him. No way that would work.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.340 line:93%
Both of us were beaten to a pulp.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.170 line:93%
Is that something to laugh about?

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:30.990 line:93%
Yeah. I like it when I think about that time.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:37.450 line:93%
While he was getting punched to a pulp, Gang Doo wouldn't let go of the brick in his hand.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:43.560 line:93%
So I asked Gang Doo. Why did you hold onto it when you can't even punch him? Guess what he said.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.070 line:93%
<i>Because I was scared.</i>

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:55.320 line:93%
He wanted to run away but if he did that, I would really be beat to death.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.980 line:93%
He said he will only be able to endure it if he held onto that piece of brick.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.470 line:93%
Gang Doo is that kind of person.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:07.350 line:93%
So he won't do anything you're worried about.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:12.170 line:93%
Trust him and wait.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.070 line:93%

You said the person who cause a scene at ICU was your older brother, right?

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:12.710 line:93%
It could happen if he's tired, but you never know. So ask him to get tested.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.830 line:93%
What? Is this mine?

Why are you so busy lately?

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.820 line:93%
You don't even stop by my studio. Are you dating?

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.760 line:93%
Unni! Is this the time to talk about those things?

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.650 line:93%
What about it? Gang Doo must feel so lonely.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:59.640 line:93%
This is the time you two should be dating.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:08.360 line:93%
If you can't because of this and that, those are just excuses. Just date him.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.480 line:93%
Not yet.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:18.610 line:93%
Why not? You're the one said you want to stay by Gang Doo's side, have you forgotten?

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:23.460 line:93%
It's still true but I will bear it.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.940 line:93%
If he's with me, Gang Doo will continue to pretend he's alright.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.380 line:93%
He should mourn now.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.930 line:93%
That way he will be comforted later.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.860 line:93%
We weren't able to do that.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.780 line:93%
Because we were angry and apologetic toward one another.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:02.720 line:93%
Don't worry about what Wan Jin said.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.710 line:93%
I am not dating.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.800 line:93%
It's good if you date.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.020 line:93%
It would be even better if you're not dating him.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.190 line:93%
It's cold. Get going.

She came everyday but she told me not to tell you.

Oh, I told you.

Geez, you didn't even know where the food you eat came from.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:09.930 line:93%
Why are you just nibbling? Here is the sausage, your favorite.

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.340 line:93%

- Eat a lot.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.390 line:93%
- Gang Doo!
- Hyung!

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.480 line:93%
Look at his temper.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.400 line:93%
Why are you here?

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.320 line:93%
To catch the bus.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.950 line:93%
How about you?

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.260 line:93%
Did you go somewhere?

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.250 line:93%
Did you eat?

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.740 line:93%
No.

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.280 line:93%
Good. Shall we eat together then?

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.930 line:93%
No.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.710 line:93%
Then do you want to watch me eat?

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.380 line:93%
That won't happen. Since it won't happen,

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.600 line:93%

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.320 line:93%

You're really a fool.

Don't come. Really, don't come.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.790 line:93%
Why are you sitting in the dark?

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.980 line:93%
I guess it must be hard to make a living.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.580 line:93%
That's why there are only food shows and people eating on TV.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:35.060 line:93%
Why didn't you set the table properly?

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.020 line:93%
- Mom. Did you finish all of this?
- Yeah.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.750 line:93%
Still, I feel empty. No matter how much I eat, I feel empty.

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:49.800 line:93%
You should have reheated them. It was cold.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.720 line:93%
I am sorry.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.360 line:93%
I am sorry for making you eat alone.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.090 line:93%
It's nothing new.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:18.880 line:93%
As you get older, you're alone more and more.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.860 line:93%
Then you should have just lived with him.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.460 line:93%
What?

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:29.450 line:93%
Why did you marry Dad if you're going to live apart like this?

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:32.020 line:93%
I didn't know this will happen.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:38.410 line:93%
I shouldn't have brought it up first if it was going to be like this.

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:40.650 line:93%
What?

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:42.540 line:93%
Marriage.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.370 line:93%
You did?

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:53.050 line:93%
I don't know why I did that. I hate him and can't stand him.

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:56.120 line:93%
Yet you're telling me to get married.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.750 line:93%
Yeah.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:04.610 line:93%
Get married. At least give it a try.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:11.580 line:93%
Even though I say I hate him I think it was better when I was with him.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:19.010 line:93%
What is that?

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.900 line:93%
That?

00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:47.700 line:93%
Don't buy these things from now on.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:52.490 line:93%
Rather, don't ever come again.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.040 line:93%
Seriously,

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.950 line:93%

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:46.200 line:93%
I can't do this, Granny.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:58.470 line:93%
You get to work on an independent project? It hasn't been that long that you started working here.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:04.000 line:93%
Are you talented or are you talented in something else?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.400 line:93%
Women have it so easy at times like this.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:13.200 line:93%
Go along with the CEO's mood and smile at him a few times, then you walk away with a project right away.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.100 line:93%
- Team Leader.
- What?

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.600 line:93%
You're insulting the CEO, not me.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.400 line:93%
The reason the CEO gave me this project...

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.500 line:93%
I'm sure it's not as low as you think.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.000 line:93%
What? What did I say?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.200 line:93%
You have a tendency to tolerate things when you're not sure.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.300 line:93%
Listen carefully. Moon Soo.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.400 line:93%
Have some. It's a tea that your grandmother gave me last time.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:58.400 line:93%
She gave it to me saying I should drink it when I can't sleep and struggling. But it looks like you need it more.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.400 line:93%
At her age, she was still very healthy...

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.900 line:93%
Why do you bring up her age now?

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:09.400 line:93%
If you lived a long time, is it okay to die?

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.000 line:93%
Is there such a thing as good death in this world?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000 line:93%
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.900 line:93%
Well... I didn't come here to talk about that. Never mind.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.000 line:93%
What are you building here?

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.200 line:93%
It's near the retirement homes.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:35.400 line:93%
It's closest to the road, so the VIP parking lot will be built there.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.000 line:93%
Perfect.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.200 line:93%
We can transfer the memorial park to this spot, right?

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.800 line:93%
If I bypass the parking lot entrance, it is possible.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.600 line:93%
But the retirement homes... it costs 1.2 billion won per person to move in.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:57.300 line:93%
It's the main business for Cheongyu. The city won't approve the permit.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.970 line:93%
That's why in the back of Yeongudong where there aren't many pedestrians...

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000 line:93%
They wanted to build it half-hearted and hide it.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.500 line:93%
In any case, you're saying it's possible as long as you get the city permit, right?

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.800 line:93%
What are you doing right now?

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:17.500 line:93%
I don't know for sure either. I don't know.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:24.940 line:93%
But when I come back, please help me out.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.300 line:93%
It's bitter. It must be really good for you.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.600 line:93%
Scared me.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.400 line:93%
You told me not to come here. Why did you come then?

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.400 line:93%
I didn't come to see you.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.300 line:93%
Then, you weren't going to see me having come all the way here?

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.060 line:93%
Work. Don't mind me.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:14.850 line:93%
How can I not mind you?

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:21.730 line:93%
The memorial park design... The CEO gave it to me to work on.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.800 line:93%
Great.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.800 line:93%
You started it. You can't get yourself out alone.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:37.790 line:93%
We're going to do it together, okay?

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.280 line:93%
Excuse me.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.490 line:93%
I was going to call you anyway.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.300 line:93%
Let's go.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.600 line:93%
To where?

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.800 line:93%
Where else? We have a lot to talk about.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:12.860 line:93%
Let's go then. Even though I don't know what you're talking about.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.500 line:93%
What's going on? Did she get sick of eating good food?

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.800 line:93%
Why is the director acting that way toward Gang Doo oppa?

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.400 line:93%
Unni, shouldn't you follow them?

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.800 line:93%
He's doing that on purpose for me to see him.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.800 line:93%
Oh, my Unni, what's with this confidence?

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.000 line:93%
The two of them left all so happy.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.400 line:93%
His eyes. His eyes didn't smile.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.000 line:93%
Only his mouth smiled.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.670 line:93%
I catch him all the time.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.000 line:93%
I just got caught to be used, huh?

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000 line:93%
Stay five minutes longer before you go. It'd look funny if you go now.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.600 line:93%
You're too obvious.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.700 line:93%
Ha Moon Soo doesn't seem like the type of person who'd misunderstand and have a change of heart of things like this.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:32.800 line:93%
If I don't do this, I didn't think I can leave that place.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.800 line:93%
I almost brought out Moon Soo with me.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.600 line:93%
Thanks for getting caught with me.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:46.700 line:93%
You're attractive. I like it more because you don't seem to know that.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:51.600 line:93%
Don't fall for me. My situation is complicated as is.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.400 line:93%
I might fall for you if I see you longer. I'd better get going.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.800 line:93%
It was true about having something to say to you.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:05.610 line:93%
The land Cheongyu is trying to purchase... You still haven't met the owner, right?

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.600 line:93%
- Assistant.
- Yes?

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.200 line:93%
Water.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:41.000 line:93%
What are you doing? What don't you like now?

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000 line:93%
The pose... Isn't it a bit awkward?

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.400 line:93%
What are you saying? All this is my know-how that comes out of my experience.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.000 line:93%
Is this possible? Are you sure you've done this?

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.000 line:93%
I mean... Like this.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.500 line:93%
See? It's weird.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.400 line:93%
Then... then, what do you want me to do?

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.000 line:93%
First, wrap around the neck and stroke the shoulder with the other hand...

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.600 line:93%
Come down slowly, hold hand...

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.100 line:93%
Ah, right...

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.400 line:93%
Here.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.000 line:93%
What is it?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.100 line:93%
My first salary was bigger than I thought.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.200 line:93%
It's a gift.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.800 line:93%
If you do this, it's like I'm taking the money away.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:59.000 line:93%
When we went to the New Year party for the webtoon artists last week? When you skydived using the VR...

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.600 line:93%
You were having so much fun.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.400 line:93%
Yeah, I had fun.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.600 line:93%
Thanks.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.120 line:93%
We have to begin the reinforcement work as we get rid of the waste in order to shorten our timeline.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:56.160 line:93%
When you say reinforcement, you're saying you want to bury more beams, right?

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:06.250 line:93%
I feel like I'm looking at myself.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:15.200 line:93%
I'm talking about you. Looking at someone who's not interested in you. You seem like me.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.800 line:93%
If they hurry, it will be completed this week. Then, the construction...

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.600 line:93%
Are you like this with Ha Moon Soo, too?

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.000 line:93%
You can only talk about work when you're face-to-face with her?

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:34.000 line:93%
So, you gave the memorial park design to someone who has no practical experience...

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.700 line:93%
Isn't it too much for her?

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.400 line:93%
She's qualified. She'll do a good job.

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:42.100 line:93%
You want to believe that.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:45.500 line:93%
In the end, you're playing the Daddy-Long-Legs.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:50.300 line:93%
Keep doing this with you... It makes me feel uncomfortable.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:57.000 line:93%
I guess... Ha Moon Soo must feel the same way with me.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000 line:93%
Is that something you can say in front of me?

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.400 line:93%
Are you saying this on purpose to hurt my pride?

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.400 line:93%
Yoo Jin.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.580 line:93%
Do I seem like I'm being stubborn for no reason?

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.820 line:93%
You don't seem yourself. Why are you acting this way?

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:15.640 line:93%
I thought I'd be different, too.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:23.030 line:93%
I didn't think I'd be swayed by my emotion like other people. I tried so hard.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.740 line:93%
But I'm not confident.

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:33.920 line:93%
If you want to get rid of me, don't be like this.

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:40.490 line:93%
You've completed the vendor bidding, right?

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.730 line:93%
You really didn't call me because you missed me?

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:46.890 line:93%
I told you someone asked me to.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:49.800 line:93%
How dare they order me to come and go?

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.780 line:93%
You'll know when you go inside.

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:03.620 line:93%
What's this?

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:07.560 line:93%
I'm not sure. I'm sure you'd know when you talk to him.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.570 line:93%
<i>[Land Sales Contract]</i>

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:25.800 line:93%
I didn't know we'd get involved this way.

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.520 line:93%
The contract you gave to my granny last time.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:38.260 line:93%
You know I'm offering a much higher price than the market...

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:46.560 line:93%
I looked into it and it looks like the land is extremely important. I can't sell it this way.

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.540 line:93%
You know I'm offering a much higher price than the market...

00:48:53.970 --> 00:49:00.190 line:93%
I looked into it and it looks like the land is extremely important. I can't sell it this way.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:03.560 line:93%
I knew you were stubborn, but you're also brazen on top of that.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:09.490 line:93%
I'm not brazen. I'm just not easy. I don't care if I don't sell this land.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:13.860 line:93%
But there's this thing called Disposition of Construction Suspension.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:24.390 line:93%
You can get six months at the first trial. If it goes to the Supreme Court, you can get three years.

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:31.330 line:93%
It's a lot of money even if you shut down the construction site even for a day. Isn't that right?

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:35.410 line:93%
You're the one who knows about that best.

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:40.510 line:93%
I'll give you 1.5 times more than this. No more than that.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.930 line:93%
I wasn't talking about money.

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:46.020 line:93%
What's more important than money here?

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:52.050 line:93%
The contract condition. I have a request.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.980 line:93%
Did your talk go over well?

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.080 line:93%
Go.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.910 line:93%
I'll go now.

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:27.620 line:93%
You're on the same side, right?

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:31.550 line:93%
- What do you mean?
- What were you doing at that old storefront that was about to collapse last time?

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:36.270 line:93%
What did you plot with that grandma and that a**hole?

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:37.430 line:93%
It's not like that.

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:44.380 line:93%
She left behind that golden property to the guy who's not related to her at all. You want me to believe that?

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.910 line:93%
Was she senile?

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:47.010 line:93%
Stop it.

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:51.210 line:93%
She should've died quietly if she was going to die. Why did she have to give it to a guy like that? So annoying...

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.620 line:93%
I said stop it!

00:50:54.900 --> 00:51:01.230 line:93%
If you talk about my Mama that way once more...

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:08.020 line:93%
What's wrong with you?

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:11.740 line:93%
I wasn't denigrating that grandma or anything...

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:15.610 line:93%
When you get old... people are all the same.

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:18.430 line:93%
What do you mean same?

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.220 line:93%
People are different.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:32.360 line:93%
Thousands, tens and thousands, hundred thousands... No matter how many people there are...

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:39.750 line:93%
There's only one Mama to me. Only one person.

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.980 line:93%
Only one.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:51:59.720 line:93%
Welcome.

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.330 line:93%
Udon please.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.300 line:93%
All right.

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:26.420 line:93%
<i>Things you can't change no matter how hard you try,
just leave it alone. Don't try so hard.</i>

It's true that she became an orphan during the Korean war and lived in the US military base.
