(Episode 30)

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.622 line:93%
I had evidence.

00:00:16.622 --> 00:00:18.521 line:93%
The security footage
from the 18th floor.

00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:20.622 line:93%
I deleted it...

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:23.261 line:93%
because I didn't want you to
get released.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:26.792 line:93%
You're really mean, Jin Young.

00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:28.902 line:93%
Ddak Ji's life...

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.671 line:93%
was also on the line.

00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:53.652 line:93%
Do you want me to bring you
something to drink?

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:55.761 line:93%
No, it's okay.

00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:58.661 line:93%
But what brings you here?

00:01:01.462 --> 00:01:02.761 line:93%
I'm sorry, Eun Bi.

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:06.271 line:93%
I also feel apologetic
toward your brother.

00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:11.072 line:93%
I knew your brother was innocent,

00:01:11.742 --> 00:01:13.111 line:93%
but I pretended like I didn't know.

00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:16.542 line:93%
Lieutenant Jin.

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.552 line:93%
I was really young back then.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.882 line:93%
So I wasn't thinking properly.

00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:26.352 line:93%
That's why I failed to
tell the world that...

00:01:26.492 --> 00:01:28.022 line:93%
your brother was innocent.

00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:34.591 line:93%
If you had told the truth back then,

00:01:38.572 --> 00:01:40.772 line:93%
do you think he would've been
ruled in court as innocent...

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.912 line:93%
and would've avoided going to jail?

00:01:51.852 --> 00:01:53.582 line:93%
The people who believe that...

00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:56.182 line:93%
my brother's innocent is me,
my brother,

00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:57.852 line:93%
Officer Oh,

00:01:58.052 --> 00:01:59.721 line:93%
and you.

00:02:03.962 --> 00:02:05.292 line:93%
There's a total of four people now.

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:12.102 line:93%
I'm very sorry.

00:02:14.302 --> 00:02:17.571 line:93%
I feel apologetic toward both you
and your brother.

00:02:19.142 --> 00:02:21.682 line:93%
I really don't know
how I should apologize.

00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:24.182 line:93%
There's nothing you can do now.

00:02:26.982 --> 00:02:28.052 line:93%
You can...

00:02:31.082 --> 00:02:32.751 line:93%
just feel sorry often...

00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:36.321 line:93%
and think of my brother.

00:02:41.392 --> 00:02:42.462 line:93%
I...

00:02:44.902 --> 00:02:46.272 line:93%
was really upset...

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:49.571 line:93%
because no one in this world
seemed to feel...

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:52.672 line:93%
apologetic toward my brother.

00:02:58.482 --> 00:03:00.012 line:93%
I know that...

00:03:01.552 --> 00:03:04.552 line:93%
you weren't the person who
made him suffer.

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:09.992 line:93%
But if you truly feel sorry,

00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:13.631 line:93%
please don't forget about him...

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:16.202 line:93%
and keep feeling sorry.

00:03:25.941 --> 00:03:28.012 line:93%
Here's your pizza.

00:03:31.281 --> 00:03:32.311 line:93%
Bye, then.

00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:50.131 line:93%
Are you home?

00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:54.071 line:93%
My goodness, why did you buy pizza?

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:57.242 line:93%
I normally can't buy this because
it's so expensive.

00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:00.841 line:93%
I was worried that you might
not have eaten dinner yet.

00:04:01.272 --> 00:04:02.381 line:93%
I hope you enjoy it.

00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:04.281 line:93%
Thank you. Let's eat.

00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:09.452 line:93%
Mom, did you visit Dad's grave?

00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:11.791 line:93%
Yes, I did.

00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.652 line:93%
Let's go together next time.

00:04:14.091 --> 00:04:15.121 line:93%
Okay.

00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:23.301 line:93%
Hey.

00:04:24.562 --> 00:04:25.671 line:93%
Right now?

00:04:27.702 --> 00:04:28.942 line:93%
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:31.471 line:93%
Mom, I'll be right back.

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:32.572 line:93%
Where are you going?

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.572 line:93%
Upstairs. He has something
to say to me.

00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:37.142 line:93%
My goodness. Hey.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.082 line:93%
At this hour?

00:04:40.551 --> 00:04:43.822 line:93%
You worked together all day,
and you'll be seeing him tomorrow.

00:04:43.822 --> 00:04:45.421 line:93%
Why does he have to
talk to you at this hour?

00:04:45.692 --> 00:04:48.322 line:93%
It's regarding work.
I'll be right back.

00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:51.731 line:93%
I really don't like that you spend
too much time with him.

00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:55.502 line:93%
I don't want people to
see you guys together.

00:04:55.502 --> 00:04:57.301 line:93%
And I'm also scared that
someone like him...

00:04:57.301 --> 00:04:59.671 line:93%
might lose his mind and
start liking you.

00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:00.671 line:93%
Mom.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:02.601 line:93%
What?

00:05:02.601 --> 00:05:04.942 line:93%
I don't want you to talk badly
about Officer Oh from now on.

00:05:05.012 --> 00:05:09.341 line:93%
Why not? Do you have
feelings for him?

00:05:09.712 --> 00:05:12.611 line:93%
No, I don't deserve to like him.

00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:17.122 line:93%
Why? Why not?

00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:21.022 line:93%
Just do as I say.

00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:25.591 line:93%
From now on, I want you to
treat him with respect.

00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:26.861 line:93%
Please do me a favor.

00:05:28.902 --> 00:05:29.962 line:93%
I'm going to go now.

You and Chul Gi seemed to be
talking about something serious.

00:06:23.022 --> 00:06:24.122 line:93%
What was it about?

00:06:24.221 --> 00:06:26.091 line:93%
I called you over to tell you.

00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:27.522 line:93%

(Witness, Betray, Murder,
Prosecutor Joo Sung Woo, Ms. Hong)

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:37.531 line:93%
This means Lee Kwang Ho
killed everyone.

00:06:38.872 --> 00:06:42.541 line:93%
We'll be able to arrest him if we
succeed in making this public.

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:44.541 line:93%
But there's no evidence.
That's the problem.

00:06:44.942 --> 00:06:46.911 line:93%
Gook Su Ran's been around
Lee Kwang Ho for years,

00:06:47.012 --> 00:06:50.241 line:93%
but we still won't be able to lock
him up with just her testimony.

00:06:50.642 --> 00:06:52.681 line:93%
Do you think we should look into
Ms. Hong?

00:06:52.752 --> 00:06:54.712 line:93%
Yes, I'm thinking about doing that
starting from tomorrow.

00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:59.752 line:93%
Mr. Cha probably took care of
the scene, right?

00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:01.861 line:93%
Probably.

00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:04.762 line:93%
He went missing after that incident.

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:07.731 line:93%
I'm pretty sure Gook Su Ran
knows where he is.

00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:11.531 line:93%
Let's go ask her tomorrow.

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:14.702 line:93%
No, you should look into
Ms. Hong tomorrow.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:16.142 line:93%
I'll go see Chairwoman Gook.

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:18.942 line:93%
- Why?
- You and Inspector Park...

00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:20.642 line:93%
are going to get punished tomorrow.

00:07:21.372 --> 00:07:22.741 line:93%
You guys lost a witness.

a pay cut, right?

Really? My gosh.

00:07:44.832 --> 00:07:46.332 line:93%
What are you doing?

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.702 line:93%
What happened?

00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:52.541 line:93%
What do you think? We need to
wait a couple of days.

00:07:52.642 --> 00:07:54.981 line:93%
I'm glad you're not going to
get punished right away.

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:57.382 line:93%
I was worried that we'd end up
as sitting ducks.

I think they wanted to
make us stay quiet.

We were told to find

It's a very sensitive issue,
so I understand.

Hey, that's enough.

Is she really not going to see me?

- Of course.
- Did you really tell her?

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:25.541 line:93%
Did you really tell her
that I'm here.

00:08:25.541 --> 00:08:28.171 line:93%
Do you think I don't know how to
tell her something that simple?

Yes.

I'm sorry. It's my fault.

Your fault?

However, he never treated me
like his son.

00:14:53.992 --> 00:14:56.461 line:93%
But when it's important, he uses the
media to reiterate the fact...

that I'm not his birth son.

00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:02.842 line:93%
He adopted me
for his election campaign.

00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:04.742 line:93%
And this is how he throws me away?

00:15:05.711 --> 00:15:07.811 line:93%
How can I avenge you?

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:11.242 line:93%
He's still your father.

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:17.281 line:93%
He's a perfectionist.
It's hard to find his weakness.

00:15:18.522 --> 00:15:19.791 line:93%
I'll give it to you.

So, I'm giving it to you.

wanted to give it to you.

00:15:38.742 --> 00:15:40.071 line:93%
you can use it.

"Odong Blowfish House".

It's obviously evidence.

00:26:19.382 --> 00:26:21.282 line:93%
Were you trying
to destroy evidence?

You're under arrest as the suspect
of Odong Blowfish House Murder.

Mr. Cha. Look for Mr. Cha first!

Let's go.

Was it you?

00:26:44.201 --> 00:26:45.941 line:93%
And you lied to me?

00:26:46.911 --> 00:26:49.941 line:93%
It wasn't enough to blame
innocent young kids,

00:26:50.711 --> 00:26:52.681 line:93%
and it wasn't enough
to kill Ddak Ji?

00:26:53.711 --> 00:26:55.782 line:93%
Why did you lie to me again?

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:57.852 line:93%
You're foolish.

00:26:59.152 --> 00:27:01.491 line:93%
You still don't know
who is on your side.

00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:03.862 line:93%
What are you doing? Take her.

00:27:03.921 --> 00:27:04.961 line:93%
Okay.

00:27:07.961 --> 00:27:09.961 line:93%
Officer Oh, get the evidence.

Sir, the result for
Chairwoman Gook's evidence came out.

00:28:52.671 --> 00:28:53.771 line:93%
Should I go get it?

00:28:53.771 --> 00:28:54.802 line:93%
No.

00:28:55.802 --> 00:28:56.872 line:93%
I'll go.

00:28:57.642 --> 00:28:58.671 line:93%
Okay.

00:29:29.142 --> 00:29:32.671 line:93%
Chairwoman Gook.
Where is Jang Pil Sung?

00:29:34.372 --> 00:29:36.741 line:93%
We know he's alive.

Where is he?

00:29:47.221 --> 00:29:48.892 line:93%
We checked,

00:29:49.261 --> 00:29:52.961 line:93%
and the blood belongs
to Prosecutor Joo Sung Woo.

00:29:53.431 --> 00:29:55.132 line:93%
The fingerprints on the handle...

belong to you.

Did you kill Ms. Hong too?

00:30:29.602 --> 00:30:30.731 line:93%
All right.

00:30:31.461 --> 00:30:32.872 line:93%
We'll take it slow.

00:30:33.372 --> 00:30:34.872 line:93%
We have a lot of time.

00:30:36.842 --> 00:30:40.312 line:93%
We have a lot to talk about
other than this case.

00:30:59.092 --> 00:31:01.161 line:93%
Get a statement from her first.

Is it over?

00:31:15.542 --> 00:31:16.582 line:93%
Did she confess?

00:31:18.812 --> 00:31:19.812 line:93%
No.

00:31:23.852 --> 00:31:25.652 line:93%
Let's not get too anxious.

00:31:26.322 --> 00:31:28.691 line:93%
The truth will be revealed one day.

00:31:32.892 --> 00:31:33.892 line:93%
But still...

00:31:33.991 --> 00:31:36.761 line:93%
we got this far,
and we even arrested Gook Su Ran.

Pardon?

00:31:56.751 --> 00:31:57.921 line:93%
I said, "arrest him".

It's a crime to impersonate
an officer.

Are you going to arrest him?
You won't be able to.

Where he should have gone
a long time ago.

I think Mr. Cha is in danger.

I must speak to Chairwoman Gook.

Do you still not see
who's on your side?

00:33:41.792 --> 00:33:44.062 line:93%
- Did Lee Kwang Ho do it?
- What if he did?

00:33:44.062 --> 00:33:45.431 line:93%
I'll have to arrest him.
