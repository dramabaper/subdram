1
00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:08.672
I heard everything.

2
00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:11.412
That prosecutor was saying that the accident...

3
00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:14.641
that happened 16 years ago was your fault.

4
00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.961
Why didn't you go back? What happened?

5
00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:30.161
Answer me.

6
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:34.731
I mean,

7
00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.561
is this true?

8
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.101
Why aren't you saying anything? Tell me.

9
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.572
Is everything he told you...

10
00:00:44.572 --> 00:00:46.311
- the truth? - I...

11
00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:51.381
If...

12
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.152
If what I did had caused the accident,

13
00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:00.621
then yes,

14
00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:04.292
I was the one who started everything.

15
00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:05.431
So...

16
00:01:06.392 --> 00:01:07.931
So it's all because of you...

17
00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:12.032
that the accident had happened,

18
00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:15.702
that my dad died,

19
00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:19.142
and that I'm here...

20
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:20.942
in this state?

21
00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:23.741
I'm sorry, Soo Chang.

22
00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:24.812
Why...

23
00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:27.922
Why are you sorry?

24
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:29.922
Why?

25
00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:31.422
You didn't do this.

26
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:34.392
Tell me you didn't do this.

27
00:01:41.202 --> 00:01:42.801
Say it!

28
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:51.642
You scumbag.

29
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:59.252
You could have just lied to me that it wasn't you.

30
00:02:06.452 --> 00:02:09.592
We caught the person that falsely charged my dad,

31
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:12.432
and we also arrested a murderer together.

32
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:15.861
We did all that together.

33
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:19.032
What am I supposed to do now?

34
00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:24.772
Gong Soo Chang.

35
00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:26.611
You scum.

36
00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:28.581
Detective Cha.

37
00:02:29.312 --> 00:02:30.812
I heard they caught the culprit.

38
00:02:31.182 --> 00:02:32.951
But why is Director Tak being testified?

39
00:02:33.212 --> 00:02:34.581
Just wait a moment, Reporter Song.

40
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:47.092
Well, this is how it was supposed to end.

41
00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:49.661
That's what my life is destined to be.

42
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:55.571
But I've come so far.

43
00:02:57.372 --> 00:02:58.372
I...

44
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.682
I thought I wouldn't be lonely from now on.

45
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.981
The person that helped me...

46
00:03:09.152 --> 00:03:11.222
was the person that had ruined my life.

47
00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:24.772
Why did it have to be this way?

48
00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:33.671
Jin Soo A is being interrogated on the other side.

49
00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:37.581
She's the culprit of Kim Jong Doo and Jo Hang Joon's murders.

50
00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:40.212
And also the attempted murder of Superintendent Ma.

51
00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:42.052
But you'd know all this already.

52
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:47.192
We already checked the DNAs.

53
00:03:47.391 --> 00:03:48.592
Well,

54
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:50.831
I don't know anything about that.

55
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:55.302
And you were with her just before you came here.

56
00:03:56.962 --> 00:03:58.171
What's your relationship with her?

57
00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:01.071
I've been supporting her ever since...

58
00:04:01.472 --> 00:04:03.002
she was in the orphanage.

59
00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:06.972
Does that have anything to do with the fact...

60
00:04:07.682 --> 00:04:09.442
that she has been committing crimes?

61
00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:12.611
So you admit to the fact that she has committed crimes.

62
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:13.782
You should...

63
00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:16.152
ask her about that.

64
00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:41.581
How's your wound?

65
00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:48.922
I know that you can hear and speak. The orphanage director told me.

66
00:04:57.992 --> 00:05:01.131
That's right. This is what you've been looking for.

67
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:04.372
You took the fake one. This is the real lighter.

68
00:05:06.302 --> 00:05:07.701
I know that it isn't just a lighter,

69
00:05:07.701 --> 00:05:10.242
and I have listened to the recording inside.

70
00:05:12.372 --> 00:05:14.412
This is the reason why you killed Kim Jong Doo...

71
00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:17.482
and Detective Jo Hang Joon, right?

72
00:05:18.112 --> 00:05:19.812
And it was under Director Tak's orders.

73
00:05:26.122 --> 00:05:28.492
Gosh, you can't do this.

74
00:05:28.492 --> 00:05:31.192
- Move over. - We didn't force him here.

75
00:05:31.562 --> 00:05:33.992
He agreed to the interrogation by himself.

76
00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:36.062
This isn't illegal.

77
00:05:40.232 --> 00:05:41.571
Detective Dokgo.

78
00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:42.841
Reporter Song.

79
00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:46.172
Why is Director Tak a witness...

80
00:05:46.771 --> 00:05:49.612
to the culprit that killed Detective Jo Hang Joon?

81
00:05:51.182 --> 00:05:52.182
That is...

82
00:05:53.112 --> 00:05:55.821
Kim Jong Doo had threatened Director Tak.

83
00:05:56.982 --> 00:06:00.122
And Detective Jo was investigating Kim Jong Doo's case.

84
00:06:00.292 --> 00:06:02.422
Do you admit to the murder of these two people?

85
00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:10.631
If you really don't wish to talk, you can just write it down.

86
00:06:13.201 --> 00:06:14.542
But Gong Soo Chang...

87
00:06:20.372 --> 00:06:22.042
Was it because you thought...

88
00:06:22.141 --> 00:06:23.841
he was the son of the culprit who caused the accident?

89
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:27.112
Is that why you wanted vengeance?

90
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:30.721
So I get why you attacked him.

91
00:06:31.492 --> 00:06:33.721
It was for your personal revenge.

92
00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:36.761
Then how about Kim Jong Doo and Detective Jo?

93
00:06:45.901 --> 00:06:48.401
Have you ever wondered...

94
00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:53.372
why Director Tak was never involved in these murders?

95
00:06:54.742 --> 00:06:56.912
Or why you had to be the one to kill them?

96
00:07:02.281 --> 00:07:05.721
Did you order Jin Soo A to commit these murders?

97
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:09.091
You ordered Jin Soo A to kill...

98
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.492
Kim Jong Doo...

99
00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:13.531
and our Hang Joon.

100
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:15.062
It seems like...

101
00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:20.201
she hasn't given you any information.

102
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:23.102
If she had,

103
00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:25.442
you wouldn't need to do this to me.

104
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:28.442
Don't.

105
00:07:30.752 --> 00:07:33.151
Whom are you accusing of murder instigation?

106
00:07:42.922 --> 00:07:44.432
This isn't going to be easy.

107
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.562
How's Soo A?

108
00:07:47.562 --> 00:07:49.162
She's even refusing to write anything down.

109
00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:52.771
With the way things are going, we might have to let Director Tak go.

110
00:07:58.711 --> 00:07:59.912
Director Tak.

111
00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:03.341
Ji An.

112
00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:05.482
I heard everything. Why would you instigate a murder?

113
00:08:05.482 --> 00:08:07.451
- There's been a misunderstanding. - Of course.

114
00:08:07.781 --> 00:08:10.151
Those detectives are completely misled.

115
00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:11.891
I'll see you later.

116
00:08:15.122 --> 00:08:16.692
Director Tak.

117
00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:22.162
The trash can is on the right side of the door.

118
00:08:25.232 --> 00:08:26.771
That lighter is a fake one.

119
00:08:29.602 --> 00:08:31.511
I'm sorry you went through so much trouble.

120
00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:34.142
My partner is quick with his hands, so he switched them...

121
00:08:34.142 --> 00:08:36.042
in Chairman Jo's room.

122
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:38.282
Please recycle.

123
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:41.922
I won't see you off. I'll probably see you again soon.

124
00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:51.932
Reporter Song.

125
00:08:52.692 --> 00:08:54.201
You said you had something to say to me.

126
00:08:55.961 --> 00:08:57.162
I do too.

127
00:08:58.302 --> 00:09:00.132
On the day my dad died,

128
00:09:01.101 --> 00:09:04.042
he got a phone call, then said he suddenly had to do something...

129
00:09:04.042 --> 00:09:05.812
before he came to see me.

130
00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:08.611
So I looked for the last person he talked to.

131
00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:12.981
It was you.

132
00:09:12.981 --> 00:09:15.721
What? Me?

133
00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:17.652
Oh Soo Cheol is your uncle, isn't he?

134
00:09:17.652 --> 00:09:19.292
I just talked to him on the phone.

135
00:09:20.052 --> 00:09:21.961
He said he thinks...

136
00:09:22.721 --> 00:09:24.861
you used his phone during that time.

137
00:09:26.692 --> 00:09:30.772
Do you remember the last thing you said to my dad?

138
00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:35.601
The last phone call I had with Detective Song...

139
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.412
I do.

140
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:42.382
But I didn't say anything much. I just said...

141
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:44.981
I envy your daughter.

142
00:09:44.981 --> 00:09:48.251
She has a detective like you for a dad.

143
00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:50.652
Then what did he say?

144
00:09:50.922 --> 00:09:52.351
I'll be a dad...

145
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:55.192
who isn't an embarrassment to my daughter.

146
00:09:55.192 --> 00:09:56.762
That's what he said.

147
00:09:59.091 --> 00:10:01.762
Ssong's dad was the corrupt detective who destroyed...

148
00:10:01.762 --> 00:10:03.231
my dad's evidence of innocence.

149
00:10:03.231 --> 00:10:04.772
Like Soo Chang said,

150
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:08.201
if he didn't turn in the recorder as evidence before,

151
00:10:08.871 --> 00:10:11.142
then changed his mind at that time... and if...

152
00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:16.142
he went to see the man who asked him to fabricate the evidence,

153
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:17.981
that means...

154
00:10:18.552 --> 00:10:21.182
he changed his mind...

155
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:24.221
because of me.

156
00:10:24.951 --> 00:10:26.851
Because of you?

157
00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:28.662
And the last person...

158
00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:32.961
that Detective Song went to see was...

159
00:10:33.062 --> 00:10:35.162
Director Tak Jung Hwan.

160
00:10:36.262 --> 00:10:39.201
No, he said he did not see him that day...

161
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:43.001
He told you before that the witness died, right?

162
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:46.642
Yes.

163
00:10:46.642 --> 00:10:48.382
Kim Jong Doo was probably the witness.

164
00:10:48.382 --> 00:10:51.751
Director Tak made someone kill Kim Jong Doo...

165
00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:54.951
as well as Hang Joon.

166
00:10:57.692 --> 00:10:59.922
The man who asked Chairman Jo of Star Group...

167
00:10:59.922 --> 00:11:03.491
to falsely accuse your dad of being a corrupt officer...

168
00:11:05.562 --> 00:11:07.091
and the last person...

169
00:11:07.961 --> 00:11:10.461
that your dad met was...

170
00:11:11.532 --> 00:11:13.932
Director Tak Jung Hwan.

171
00:11:14.142 --> 00:11:15.841
That can't be right.

172
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:19.772
- Then are you saying... - Yes.

173
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:22.581
He killed someone 16 years ago.

174
00:11:22.912 --> 00:11:24.182
That's...

175
00:11:26.951 --> 00:11:28.751
probably Detective Song.

176
00:11:42.562 --> 00:11:44.071
Are you sure you'll be okay?

177
00:11:45.772 --> 00:11:48.542
I'm fine. Don't worry.

178
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:11.361
I asked him for a favor.

179
00:12:13.562 --> 00:12:16.032
I asked the man who did that to my dad...

180
00:12:17.001 --> 00:12:19.032
to help him get vindicated.

181
00:12:19.902 --> 00:12:21.741
I asked him to do that.

182
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:26.812
I laughed and begged...

183
00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:29.211
to my dad's murderer.

184
00:12:32.282 --> 00:12:34.351
That's what I did, Detective Cha.

185
00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.022
What am I going to do?

186
00:12:37.922 --> 00:12:41.121
I'm so embarrassed, and I feel so bad for my dad.

187
00:12:47.432 --> 00:12:48.861
Only if my dad...

188
00:12:50.731 --> 00:12:53.902
decided to be an embarrassment to me,

189
00:12:55.371 --> 00:12:58.111
he'd still be alive today.

190
00:13:49.591 --> 00:13:51.032
You can see Soo Chang, right?

191
00:13:53.162 --> 00:13:55.101
Do you know where he is?

192
00:13:58.471 --> 00:13:59.571
Darn it.

193
00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:02.741
He doesn't have much time left. Where did he go?

194
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:04.772
This place really hurts...

195
00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:06.871
because you found out everything.

196
00:14:08.711 --> 00:14:11.282
Something will happen, and it'll make you cry a lot.

197
00:14:11.282 --> 00:14:13.412
But don't blame yourself too much.

198
00:14:15.152 --> 00:14:16.851
Is this what you meant...

199
00:14:17.451 --> 00:14:20.991
Everything began with you.

200
00:14:20.991 --> 00:14:24.331
So you have to finish this too.

201
00:14:25.692 --> 00:14:26.831
What do you mean?

202
00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:29.632
Do you want to let that soul live?

203
00:14:30.361 --> 00:14:31.601
Then...

204
00:14:33.302 --> 00:14:35.471
give it to him.

205
00:14:37.201 --> 00:14:38.812
Give it to him?

206
00:14:40.111 --> 00:14:41.211
Give what?

207
00:14:41.711 --> 00:14:45.081
You have to find the answer yourself.

208
00:14:54.361 --> 00:14:57.221
- Hello? - This is Haneul Orphanage.

209
00:15:02.245 --> 00:15:07.245
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E31 Two Cops "Why Did it Have to Be This Way?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

210
00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:14.211
Cha Dong Tak.

211
00:15:16.012 --> 00:15:17.912
You played with me.

212
00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.821
Anyway, this means...

213
00:15:21.652 --> 00:15:25.591
Dong Tak has that lighter.

214
00:15:28.262 --> 00:15:30.961
I'll show him a very funny picture.

215
00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:35.132
No.

216
00:15:35.662 --> 00:15:37.672
What are you planning to do?

217
00:15:47.172 --> 00:15:49.341
(Seoul Central Police Station)

218
00:15:54.012 --> 00:15:55.581
Gong Soo Chang!

219
00:15:57.751 --> 00:15:59.721
- Where have you... - Don't...

220
00:16:02.292 --> 00:16:03.861
say anything for now.

221
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:07.091
I'm not here to forgive you.

222
00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:13.731
I saw Director Tak getting released.

223
00:16:14.071 --> 00:16:17.042
Don't let Ji An dig deeper into her dad's incident.

224
00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:19.312
She might get hurt.

225
00:16:20.111 --> 00:16:21.341
What do you mean?

226
00:16:26.512 --> 00:16:28.321
So I followed him.

227
00:16:28.522 --> 00:16:32.022
Cha Dong Tak. You played with me.

228
00:16:32.022 --> 00:16:34.662
I'll show him a very funny picture.

229
00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:36.361
He might be up to something again.

230
00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:37.861
What should we do?

231
00:16:41.302 --> 00:16:43.001
We need to persuade Soo A.

232
00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:51.672
I got a call from the orphanage director today.

233
00:16:51.871 --> 00:16:53.571
This is Haneul Orphanage.

234
00:16:54.512 --> 00:16:56.412
I have a question for you.

235
00:16:56.981 --> 00:16:58.951
Did Director Tak...

236
00:17:00.012 --> 00:17:01.851
really make Soo A...

237
00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:04.591
do those things?

238
00:17:04.692 --> 00:17:05.791
Yes.

239
00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:10.021
We need her to make a confession...

240
00:17:10.021 --> 00:17:12.531
in order to arrest Director Tak.

241
00:17:12.892 --> 00:17:14.801
I'm not sure if this will help you.

242
00:17:15.362 --> 00:17:17.061
But in the past,

243
00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:20.432
Soo A hurt one of the boys...

244
00:17:20.432 --> 00:17:22.372
who had been bullying her.

245
00:17:25.271 --> 00:17:27.942
He was much bigger than her,

246
00:17:28.612 --> 00:17:31.311
but she hurt him very brutally.

247
00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:34.221
And...

248
00:17:34.751 --> 00:17:36.852
Director Tak saw her.

249
00:17:36.852 --> 00:17:37.991
Soo A.

250
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:40.892
May I ask you to do this?

251
00:17:50.061 --> 00:17:54.172
And after that day, he became interested in her.

252
00:17:54.172 --> 00:17:55.872
Then he sent her to Japan...

253
00:17:56.172 --> 00:17:58.511
and gave her a special education.

254
00:17:58.511 --> 00:18:01.511
That's how he made a puppet that'd only listen to him.

255
00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:07.751
I'll go alone from here.

256
00:18:11.422 --> 00:18:12.622
Don't go anywhere.

257
00:18:34.682 --> 00:18:36.182
You should eat.

258
00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:41.152
A child who saw the world through twisted eyes.

259
00:18:43.152 --> 00:18:44.951
A child who was angry at the world...

260
00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:47.822
and had no one by her side.

261
00:18:51.092 --> 00:18:52.291
I was like that too.

262
00:18:53.991 --> 00:18:56.261
On the day of your parents' accident,

263
00:18:59.102 --> 00:19:01.471
you lost your whole world in one second.

264
00:19:04.642 --> 00:19:06.612
My parents died because of me.

265
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:09.511
I thought I'd go crazy.

266
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:15.852
My best option was to go against the world.

267
00:19:17.352 --> 00:19:18.751
That was my solution.

268
00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:21.721
But then,

269
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:26.561
I met a man who told me that was wrong.

270
00:19:26.692 --> 00:19:30.902
He told me I was wrong and that I had to start over.

271
00:19:32.801 --> 00:19:34.872
If you had met such a person,

272
00:19:34.872 --> 00:19:37.072
then you could've changed too.

273
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:46.652
What was Tak Jung Hwan like to you?

274
00:19:47.781 --> 00:19:49.281
You don't have to answer.

275
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:53.852
The confession that he told you to commit murder.

276
00:19:56.392 --> 00:19:57.832
That is the answer.

277
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:02.902
It's your choice.

278
00:20:08.602 --> 00:20:09.771
And...

279
00:20:11.541 --> 00:20:13.372
there's one thing you're wrong about.

280
00:20:15.612 --> 00:20:17.241
Gong Soo Chang.

281
00:20:19.412 --> 00:20:21.382
He's a victim just like you.

282
00:20:42.041 --> 00:20:43.971
Do you know Doo Sik's dead?

283
00:20:45.112 --> 00:20:47.442
Do you know that he liked you?

284
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:51.582
I'm pretty sure that he didn't...

285
00:20:52.652 --> 00:20:53.682
take the fall...

286
00:20:54.382 --> 00:20:57.551
just so that you could sit in here like this.

287
00:21:01.192 --> 00:21:02.892
Whom and what for...

288
00:21:03.392 --> 00:21:05.531
are you keeping so quiet?

289
00:21:09.632 --> 00:21:10.662
Dong Tak.

290
00:21:11.572 --> 00:21:15.471
I don't think Jin Soo A's going to talk.

291
00:21:18.811 --> 00:21:20.572
Forget all that.

292
00:21:21.912 --> 00:21:23.942
Director Tak...

293
00:21:28.622 --> 00:21:31.751
Children, do you remember our promise?

294
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:33.152
- Yes! - Yes!

295
00:21:33.152 --> 00:21:36.092
When a stranger offers to buy you a snack...

296
00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:39.162
or take you somewhere, what do you do?

297
00:21:39.162 --> 00:21:40.692
- Say no. - Say no.

298
00:21:40.692 --> 00:21:44.872
If that happens, go tell your mom and dad straight away.

299
00:21:44.872 --> 00:21:47.031
This is unusual for a soon-to-be minister.

300
00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:48.201
These children...

301
00:21:48.672 --> 00:21:50.872
are the law, justice,

302
00:21:51.412 --> 00:21:52.971
and our future.

303
00:21:53.372 --> 00:21:56.412
This is a special opportunity for me to remember why...

304
00:21:57.412 --> 00:21:58.981
I got into law in the first place.

305
00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:01.251
I'm Reporter Song Ji An from NBC.

306
00:22:02.551 --> 00:22:04.451
A suspect in a murder case...

307
00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:07.422
turned out to be an orphan you sponsored.

308
00:22:07.622 --> 00:22:08.822
Are you...

309
00:22:09.322 --> 00:22:11.932
involved in those murders?

310
00:22:13.932 --> 00:22:15.761
- What? - What's that about?

311
00:22:15.761 --> 00:22:17.432
- What's going on? - I don't know.

312
00:22:17.432 --> 00:22:18.602
How odd.

313
00:22:19.932 --> 00:22:22.741
That pretty lady standing there...

314
00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:24.342
seems to have...

315
00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:28.182
a serious misunderstanding about me.

316
00:22:28.311 --> 00:22:30.511
She thinks I asked someone...

317
00:22:31.152 --> 00:22:33.382
to hit someone else for me.

318
00:22:33.382 --> 00:22:34.951
Did you really?

319
00:22:36.152 --> 00:22:37.822
Would I do that?

320
00:22:39.451 --> 00:22:41.392
My wife told me that...

321
00:22:41.491 --> 00:22:44.561
we should play fair and square all the time.

322
00:22:44.791 --> 00:22:47.602
Or the police will arrest us.

323
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:53.201
Goodness, you're such a smart kid.

324
00:22:53.271 --> 00:22:56.572
You're so smart. You're so clever.

325
00:22:58.172 --> 00:22:59.211
Yes.

326
00:23:00.142 --> 00:23:02.442
In front of this smart child,

327
00:23:02.942 --> 00:23:04.412
I will tell the truth.

328
00:23:04.781 --> 00:23:05.912
In two days,

329
00:23:06.652 --> 00:23:09.521
I will take a very public position.

330
00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:11.822
In order to make sure that...

331
00:23:12.122 --> 00:23:13.892
such rumors do not hurt me,

332
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:15.721
I shall be honest...

333
00:23:16.662 --> 00:23:18.791
in all my endeavors and efforts.

334
00:23:21.001 --> 00:23:23.201
Director of Prosecutors Tak Jung Hwan

335
00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:25.501
who was named candidate for Minister of Justice...

336
00:23:25.632 --> 00:23:27.842
took a strong stance against...

337
00:23:27.842 --> 00:23:29.501
the rumors surrounding him.

338
00:23:30.102 --> 00:23:34.182
He visited a kindergarten two days before his appointment...

339
00:23:34.442 --> 00:23:39.082
and announced he would be honest and rigid in his endeavors...

340
00:23:39.082 --> 00:23:40.211
You shouldn't have...

341
00:23:41.521 --> 00:23:42.951
touched that child.

342
00:23:46.721 --> 00:23:49.922
He's Jo Hang Joon's son.

343
00:23:50.932 --> 00:23:52.932
What a coincidence.

344
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:55.801
I guess...

345
00:23:56.162 --> 00:23:58.902
I have become a politician already.

346
00:24:00.132 --> 00:24:03.001
My opponent's biggest weakness...

347
00:24:03.602 --> 00:24:05.072
is so visible.

348
00:24:05.072 --> 00:24:06.311
If you ever...

349
00:24:07.781 --> 00:24:09.711
touch Joon Soo again...

350
00:24:11.981 --> 00:24:13.051
Then...

351
00:24:13.811 --> 00:24:15.382
what about Ji An?

352
00:24:15.822 --> 00:24:20.021
The person who's putting them all in danger.

353
00:24:20.761 --> 00:24:22.221
It's not me.

354
00:24:24.662 --> 00:24:25.892
Detective Cha.

355
00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:27.961
If you keep this up,

356
00:24:28.731 --> 00:24:31.372
I will make you disappear.

357
00:24:32.672 --> 00:24:34.201
Director Tak.

358
00:24:37.301 --> 00:24:39.142
I will get you myself.

359
00:24:44.152 --> 00:24:48.021
Why won't you submit that lighter as evidence?

360
00:24:49.182 --> 00:24:53.592
I'm wondering if what you have is an empty shell too.

361
00:24:54.692 --> 00:24:56.862
I was going to do just that.

362
00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:11.711
- Ji An. - Is it true?

363
00:25:12.112 --> 00:25:15.082
- What are you talking about? - The accident 16 years ago.

364
00:25:15.642 --> 00:25:17.142
Did your dad rig the case?

365
00:25:17.951 --> 00:25:20.352
Did he kill the witness and...

366
00:25:20.382 --> 00:25:21.721
the lead detective?

367
00:25:22.922 --> 00:25:25.422
- Ji An, that's... - My dad too.

368
00:25:26.322 --> 00:25:27.692
Did he do it?

369
00:25:28.592 --> 00:25:29.761
What?

370
00:25:30.622 --> 00:25:31.862
Did you know?

371
00:25:31.862 --> 00:25:34.061
- Song Ji An. - You're a prosecutor.

372
00:25:35.602 --> 00:25:37.531
I'm giving you a chance.

373
00:25:37.932 --> 00:25:39.701
Your dad failed to do so,

374
00:25:40.172 --> 00:25:42.572
but now, you have a chance to right the wrong.

375
00:25:45.572 --> 00:25:47.781
I hope you justify your prosecutor badge.

376
00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:05.791
- Jae Hee. - Father.

377
00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:07.531
Ji An's father...

378
00:26:09.031 --> 00:26:10.632
Was that you too?

379
00:26:10.971 --> 00:26:12.932
Can't you be more understanding?

380
00:26:13.231 --> 00:26:14.971
If this blows over,

381
00:26:16.201 --> 00:26:18.541
I will become a truly great politician.

382
00:26:19.142 --> 00:26:21.041
I have yet to create...

383
00:26:21.211 --> 00:26:23.442
the nation I dreamed of.

384
00:26:23.942 --> 00:26:25.281
Soo A.

385
00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:29.682
Cut the ropes that are binding her.

386
00:26:45.372 --> 00:26:46.432
Hello?

387
00:26:46.432 --> 00:26:48.402
I'm at war with Director Tak.

388
00:26:48.642 --> 00:26:50.942
- Are you ready? - I'm ready to fight.

389
00:26:51.771 --> 00:26:53.011
Director Tak.

390
00:26:53.572 --> 00:26:56.211
He doesn't know his voice on this is damaged.

391
00:26:56.211 --> 00:26:58.511
The longer we stall, the higher the risk.

392
00:26:58.781 --> 00:27:00.511
He's already catching on.

393
00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:03.122
Captain, please arrange to brief the press.

394
00:27:03.122 --> 00:27:06.592
As if there's something incredible on this lighter.

395
00:27:06.592 --> 00:27:08.791
Are you saying he'll do something...

396
00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:10.731
to retrieve the lighter?

397
00:27:10.991 --> 00:27:13.231
Do you think he'll use Soo A?

398
00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:15.862
Director Tak...

399
00:27:16.102 --> 00:27:18.031
is a seasoned and cunning pro.

400
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:19.372
So I'll set a trap.

401
00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:20.971
And the bait?

402
00:27:33.281 --> 00:27:34.352
Sir.

403
00:27:35.051 --> 00:27:36.322
The Jin Soo A case.

404
00:27:37.622 --> 00:27:38.852
I want it.

405
00:27:39.521 --> 00:27:40.791
- That's her. - She's here.

406
00:27:40.791 --> 00:27:42.061
Any comments?

407
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:44.432
- Do you accept the charges? - Did you do it?

408
00:27:44.432 --> 00:27:46.092
- Did you? - Any comments?

409
00:27:46.092 --> 00:27:47.291
Say something.

410
00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:48.632
Did you do it?

411
00:27:48.632 --> 00:27:50.701
- Answer us. - Was it personal?

412
00:27:50.902 --> 00:27:52.301
How do you feel?

413
00:27:52.402 --> 00:27:54.301
- Do you have anything to say? - Do you?

414
00:27:54.572 --> 00:27:56.501
- Say something. - Do you admit to it?

415
00:27:58.271 --> 00:27:59.741
Give us an answer.

416
00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:02.741
Jin Soo A's heading to the Prosecutors' Office.

417
00:28:12.822 --> 00:28:14.362
(On Official Duty)

418
00:28:17.692 --> 00:28:19.832
Do Kki, take the side road, all right?

419
00:28:19.832 --> 00:28:21.461
Yes, boss.

420
00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:05.172
- I'm fine. - Are you all right?

421
00:29:20.122 --> 00:29:22.922
Hello? We found nothing.

422
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:24.491
What next?

423
00:29:24.491 --> 00:29:27.092
Let's go out. He lost them.

424
00:29:27.092 --> 00:29:29.231
- Gosh. - Gosh.

425
00:29:29.461 --> 00:29:31.672
Director Tak is an expert.

426
00:29:31.672 --> 00:29:33.832
It won't be easy to fool him.

427
00:29:36.442 --> 00:29:38.612
We need to be thorough.

428
00:29:39.412 --> 00:29:41.142
Jin Soo A isn't here.

429
00:29:41.142 --> 00:29:44.152
(Director of Prosecutors Tak Jung Hwan)

430
00:29:44.152 --> 00:29:46.011
We were lucky.

431
00:29:46.311 --> 00:29:49.481
It's a relief that you didn't do anything illegal.

432
00:29:51.751 --> 00:29:54.122
If she finds the lighter,

433
00:29:54.862 --> 00:29:56.192
everything will be over.

434
00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:00.291
Yes.

435
00:30:00.291 --> 00:30:01.961
At 3pm tomorrow,

436
00:30:01.961 --> 00:30:04.271
there will be a progress report on the investigation of the murderer...

437
00:30:04.271 --> 00:30:05.971
who is responsible for Detective Jo's murder case.

438
00:30:05.971 --> 00:30:08.801
The culprit has run away. Have you found other evidence?

439
00:30:08.801 --> 00:30:11.612
We have important information on the person...

440
00:30:11.811 --> 00:30:13.741
who has been hiding...

441
00:30:13.842 --> 00:30:16.011
the culprit all along.

442
00:30:16.011 --> 00:30:19.251
He'll probably be pressured.

443
00:30:19.251 --> 00:30:21.852
Don't search for her. I won't allow an open investigation.

444
00:30:22.281 --> 00:30:25.122
I'm in charge of the case! Do as I say!

445
00:30:25.122 --> 00:30:28.761
Then the prosecutor will do as his father says.

446
00:30:29.662 --> 00:30:32.092
But one person won't because Director Tak...

447
00:30:32.761 --> 00:30:34.632
would've asked her to do one last job.

448
00:30:36.061 --> 00:30:37.201
We'll...

449
00:30:38.832 --> 00:30:41.372
let everyone in Korea know about this.

450
00:30:45.172 --> 00:30:46.672
You choose.

451
00:30:46.942 --> 00:30:48.082
But...

452
00:30:48.811 --> 00:30:50.981
Whom was he ordering to kill?

453
00:30:52.582 --> 00:30:53.912
Cha Dong Tak.

454
00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:04.731
His name is Gong Soo Chang.

455
00:31:05.132 --> 00:31:07.731
He even hired a private guard to guard his hospital room.

456
00:31:08.231 --> 00:31:09.761
They're really close.

457
00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:14.201
Bring me the person who is the most important...

458
00:31:15.872 --> 00:31:17.642
to Cha Dong Tak.

459
00:31:50.872 --> 00:31:52.711
If you want to save your friend,

460
00:31:54.211 --> 00:31:55.942
bring me the real lighter.

461
00:32:05.366 --> 00:32:07.566
(Last Episode will air shortly.)
