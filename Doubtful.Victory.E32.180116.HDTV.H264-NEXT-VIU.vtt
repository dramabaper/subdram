00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:08.933
In the name of the almighty we pray, amen.

2
00:00:11.132 --> 00:00:12.503
Amen.

3
00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:14.673
Amen.

4
00:00:14.673 --> 00:00:15.702
(Episode 32)

5
00:00:15.702 --> 00:00:19.342
I pray that everything you do goes well.

6
00:00:19.342 --> 00:00:20.583
- Thank you. - Yes.

7
00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:22.883
Thank you.

8
00:00:22.883 --> 00:00:24.482
- Bye. - Bye.

10
00:01:19.172 --> 00:01:20.803
(Bible)

11
00:01:33.253 --> 00:01:34.553
(I put alcohol in the trophy.)

12
00:01:36.452 --> 00:01:38.422
(I waited for him. I was sad, hurt, and upset then.)

13
00:01:45.663 --> 00:01:46.962
You're pretty good.

14
00:01:48.103 --> 00:01:51.333
It's rare that someone does exactly what I like.

15
00:01:52.803 --> 00:01:56.542
He said he left it with someone. He was right in a way.

16
00:01:57.512 --> 00:01:58.542
Give it to me.

17
00:01:58.542 --> 00:02:01.682
Give this to you? Are you crazy?

18
00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:08.623
- What are you doing? - It's the basic moves.

19
00:02:09.082 --> 00:02:10.552
I guess you forgot all about them...

20
00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:12.792
since you've been focusing too much on politics.

21
00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:15.623
All right. Okay. Let me go.

22
00:02:35.742 --> 00:02:38.582
Take him away, and make him suffer. I'll get going first.

23
00:02:55.732 --> 00:02:57.873
(Personal Information)

24
00:03:03.373 --> 00:03:04.473
Hey, Lieutenant Jin.

25
00:03:05.313 --> 00:03:06.883
Oh Il Seung, no...

26
00:03:07.913 --> 00:03:10.512
- Where is this guy? - I don't know.

27
00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:12.982
I'm not trying to arrest him, so tell me.

28
00:03:12.982 --> 00:03:16.322
I'm not lying. I can't get a hold of him.

29
00:03:16.322 --> 00:03:18.292
Tell me I want to see him if you get in touch.

30
00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:19.593
Yes, sir.

31
00:03:21.022 --> 00:03:22.262
Yes, Inspector Park.

32
00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:25.832
There is no trace of him. That's right.

33
00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:28.832
- Dae Woong, check over there. - Okay.

34
00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:31.933
He's not here.

35
00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.642
You can't find him? Of course.

36
00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:38.413
He's been in an asylum for 10 years.

37
00:03:38.413 --> 00:03:40.783
So he must not be used to the outside world.

38
00:03:41.112 --> 00:03:43.082
He might be hiding in a nook somewhere.

39
00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:45.612
So search that vicinity thoroughly.

40
00:03:45.982 --> 00:03:47.052
Okay.

41
00:03:49.623 --> 00:03:50.723
Hey, let's go.

42
00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:53.723
Let's look for traces of Mr. Cha.

43
00:03:53.723 --> 00:03:54.723
Okay.

44
00:04:35.603 --> 00:04:36.672
Hey.

45
00:04:42.403 --> 00:04:45.242
I told the superiors of the prosecution about your thoughts.

46
00:04:45.742 --> 00:04:47.083
They all seemed to understand.

47
00:04:47.442 --> 00:04:49.343
What is there for them to understand?

48
00:04:49.583 --> 00:04:52.882
Most of them got to where they are right now because of me.

49
00:04:53.013 --> 00:04:55.552
Chairwoman Gook is still pleading the Fifth.

50
00:04:56.523 --> 00:04:59.052
But even if she does say anything against you,

51
00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:01.663
the superiors agreed to think of it as a biased investigation...

52
00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:02.922
by Prosecutor Kim Yoon Su.

53
00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:04.562
Okay, good job.

54
00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:08.033
But why haven't I heard from Jang Pil Sung yet?

55
00:05:09.163 --> 00:05:10.473
I think something went wrong.

56
00:05:11.273 --> 00:05:13.872
Did the whole plan go wrong, or did something happen to Jang Pil Sung?

57
00:05:14.073 --> 00:05:15.302
I think it's both.

58
00:05:17.773 --> 00:05:20.812
Mr. Cha went missing, so the Hidden Crime Team are looking for him.

59
00:05:21.643 --> 00:05:23.482
Are you saying Mr. Cha is still alive?

60
00:05:23.552 --> 00:05:27.523
Yes. And Jang Pil Sung suddenly went off the grid.

61
00:05:30.992 --> 00:05:32.093
It's either 1 of the 2.

62
00:05:33.153 --> 00:05:35.422
He either hid because he got scared that he lost Mr. Cha.

63
00:05:36.062 --> 00:05:39.232
Or he found something, and he's thinking about how to use it.

64
00:05:50.843 --> 00:05:53.013
(I waited for him.)

65
00:05:53.013 --> 00:05:54.242
(I was sad, hurt, and upset then.)

66
00:05:57.353 --> 00:05:58.953
I've hit the jackpot.

67
00:06:04.893 --> 00:06:06.562
How should I use this?

68
00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:08.492
Thank you.

69
00:06:08.593 --> 00:06:10.562
No problem. Take care.

70
00:06:10.562 --> 00:06:11.562
- Okay - Bye.

71
00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:16.362
It's just what we expected. Mr. Cha didn't come here.

72
00:06:16.463 --> 00:06:19.132
Yes, it'd be impossible for him to come here by himself.

73
00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:20.403
We already knew it'd be impossible.

74
00:06:21.603 --> 00:06:24.273
But what did Oh Il Seung... I mean, that guy.

75
00:06:24.273 --> 00:06:26.882
What did he find here? She said he kept searching.

76
00:06:27.942 --> 00:06:28.942
I don't know.

77
00:06:29.413 --> 00:06:31.083
I almost forgot to give you this.

78
00:06:31.083 --> 00:06:32.682
Don't you need this?

79
00:06:33.283 --> 00:06:35.853
I gave this to the tall, handsome officer...

80
00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:37.692
that came by earlier, but he left it behind.

81
00:06:37.953 --> 00:06:40.263
You're looking for Mr. Cha Gwang Tae, right?

82
00:06:40.263 --> 00:06:41.292
Yes.

83
00:06:42.023 --> 00:06:43.533
We'll take this. Thank you.

84
00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:44.593
Okay.

85
00:06:46.903 --> 00:06:49.302
That's weird. Why did he leave this behind?

86
00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:51.172
I'm sure he knew that this would be considered as evidence.

87
00:06:52.302 --> 00:06:54.372
Do you think he left it behind because he's no longer...

88
00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.872
allowed to enter the police agency?

89
00:06:57.573 --> 00:06:58.573
Do you think so?

90
00:07:30.073 --> 00:07:31.942
Hey, hey. Call him.

91
00:07:33.913 --> 00:07:35.942
- What? - Call him.

92
00:07:37.312 --> 00:07:39.653
Don't you think it's weird?

93
00:07:39.882 --> 00:07:42.323
He could've just given it to you.

94
00:07:42.323 --> 00:07:44.622
Why would he leave it behind? Isn't it weird?

95
00:07:45.692 --> 00:07:46.763
It is weird.

96
00:07:47.823 --> 00:07:49.663
And you said he didn't answer anyone's calls...

97
00:07:49.663 --> 00:07:50.862
including yours.

98
00:07:53.232 --> 00:07:56.132
The last person he met was that nurse, right?

99
00:08:02.502 --> 00:08:05.973
My goodness, we came all the way here and prayed.

100
00:08:06.982 --> 00:08:08.713
Something happened, didn't it?

101
00:08:09.013 --> 00:08:10.752
My gosh, what should I do?

102
00:08:15.083 --> 00:08:16.453
I think he found something here.

103
00:08:16.453 --> 00:08:21.023
Yes. So this is where he was last before his phone was turned off.

104
00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:24.192
It looks like someone got dragged here, doesn't it?

105
00:08:24.292 --> 00:08:25.763
It looks like Officer Oh's size.

106
00:08:26.562 --> 00:08:27.903
I think you're right.

107
00:08:31.973 --> 00:08:33.103
Hey, over there.

108
00:08:41.183 --> 00:08:42.343
Officer Oh!

109
00:08:43.713 --> 00:08:45.683
- Il Seung! - Call 911.

110
00:08:45.683 --> 00:08:47.482
- Il Seung. - Call 911. Hurry.

111
00:08:47.482 --> 00:08:49.522
Il Seung, are you okay?

112
00:08:49.782 --> 00:08:53.323
Hey, use this to untie him.

113
00:08:53.693 --> 00:08:55.362
Il Seung, are you okay?

114
00:08:55.423 --> 00:08:56.693
Hey, hey.

115
00:08:56.693 --> 00:08:58.093
It hurts.

116
00:08:58.093 --> 00:09:00.262
Does it hurt? He must be fine. He says it hurts.

117
00:09:00.402 --> 00:09:01.603
That means he's fine.

118
00:09:07.142 --> 00:09:09.402
You're cold, aren't you?

119
00:09:12.543 --> 00:09:13.813
My gosh.

120
00:09:15.242 --> 00:09:16.412
Gosh.

121
00:09:17.412 --> 00:09:18.412
Thank you.

122
00:09:18.412 --> 00:09:19.553
Goodbye.

123
00:09:22.252 --> 00:09:24.752
Jin Young. Gosh, it's cold.

124
00:09:25.152 --> 00:09:27.723
I need to talk to Officer Oh for a minute.

125
00:09:27.823 --> 00:09:28.862
Okay.

126
00:09:37.573 --> 00:09:40.103
Hey, are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

127
00:09:40.103 --> 00:09:41.103
I'm fine.

128
00:09:41.173 --> 00:09:42.272
Drink this.

129
00:09:42.902 --> 00:09:43.973
- It's okay. - Drink it.

130
00:09:43.973 --> 00:09:46.982
You need to warm yourself up. Drink it while it's warm.

131
00:09:47.642 --> 00:09:48.742
It was cold, wasn't it?

132
00:09:52.183 --> 00:09:55.652
By the way, what did you find here?

133
00:09:57.293 --> 00:09:59.193
I found Mr. Cha's notebook.

134
00:09:59.553 --> 00:10:02.093
He kept a record of everything that Lee Kwang Ho had asked him to do.

135
00:10:03.293 --> 00:10:06.162
And Jang Pil Sung took that from you?

136
00:10:07.103 --> 00:10:08.862
- Yes. - You could've died...

137
00:10:08.862 --> 00:10:11.902
from hypothermia if you were outside for a little longer.

138
00:10:12.872 --> 00:10:14.502
Thank you for saving me.

139
00:10:14.673 --> 00:10:16.372
I didn't say that so that you'd feel grateful.

140
00:10:16.372 --> 00:10:18.043
And there's no need to thank me.

141
00:10:20.482 --> 00:10:22.782
Why are you risking your life to catch Lee Kwang Ho?

142
00:10:22.782 --> 00:10:24.152
Do you want to catch him that badly?

143
00:10:25.612 --> 00:10:26.622
Yes.

144
00:10:29.223 --> 00:10:30.252
Aren't you scared?

145
00:10:30.752 --> 00:10:31.793
Of course, I'm scared.

146
00:10:32.693 --> 00:10:34.563
I'm scared that other people might get hurt.

147
00:10:35.122 --> 00:10:36.963
That's why I really want to catch him.

148
00:10:43.402 --> 00:10:45.203
I'm sorry, Inspector Park.

149
00:10:45.203 --> 00:10:49.203
Do you know why cops always move in pairs?

150
00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:54.242
It's so that they won't end up like you did.

151
00:10:54.382 --> 00:10:55.742
There's no one to save you.

152
00:10:56.782 --> 00:10:58.912
I want you to pair up with Jin Young starting from tomorrow.

153
00:11:00.453 --> 00:11:02.022
I want you to come back to work tomorrow.

154
00:11:02.223 --> 00:11:03.823
Let's see how things go.

155
00:11:04.323 --> 00:11:06.963
If you don't want me back, you don't need to...

156
00:11:06.963 --> 00:11:08.923
I do want you back. I do.

157
00:11:11.162 --> 00:11:13.662
I don't exactly know why, but I'm fine with you...

158
00:11:13.662 --> 00:11:15.103
and this whole situation.

159
00:11:16.203 --> 00:11:17.333
I don't know.

160
00:11:19.272 --> 00:11:20.402
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:20.642 --> 00:11:22.703
I don't know how I might change tomorrow.

162
00:11:22.703 --> 00:11:24.272
Don't trust me too much.

163
00:11:26.173 --> 00:11:28.843
Anyway, you should go home, and get some rest.

164
00:11:29.543 --> 00:11:30.583
Come in tomorrow.

165
00:11:32.213 --> 00:11:33.252
Okay.

166
00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:39.193
Driver Jin, get in the car, and drive.

167
00:11:40.392 --> 00:11:41.392
Okay.

168
00:11:54.943 --> 00:11:56.043
Bye, sir.

169
00:11:57.073 --> 00:11:58.872
Take him home safely.

170
00:11:58.872 --> 00:11:59.912
Okay.

171
00:12:05.882 --> 00:12:08.252
It's okay. I'm fine now.

172
00:12:09.252 --> 00:12:11.652
I'm glad you sorted things out with Inspector Park.

173
00:12:12.853 --> 00:12:15.362
I just can't stop feeling sorry.

174
00:12:16.093 --> 00:12:17.532
That's why you should do well.

175
00:12:18.563 --> 00:12:19.563
Okay.

176
00:12:19.693 --> 00:12:22.532
Hey, I thought my heart was going to drop a while ago.

177
00:12:22.862 --> 00:12:24.703
Well, it didn't.

178
00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:26.803
When I saw you like that before, I...

179
00:12:26.803 --> 00:12:28.703
I'm fine.

180
00:12:28.703 --> 00:12:30.112
Look. I'm fine.

181
00:12:30.673 --> 00:12:33.343
My gosh. Are you saying you're proud of what you did?

182
00:12:33.343 --> 00:12:35.213
No, that's not what I mean.

183
00:12:35.612 --> 00:12:38.252
But I'm fine, so don't get too angry.

184
00:12:39.652 --> 00:12:41.823
Hey, your face looks more pale right now.

185
00:12:43.923 --> 00:12:45.152
Okay.

186
00:12:46.252 --> 00:12:49.662
Don't ever do anything by yourself from now on.

187
00:12:50.093 --> 00:12:51.662
Okay, I won't.

188
00:12:52.963 --> 00:12:56.063
You should go inside. You need to look for Mr. Cha.

189
00:12:57.032 --> 00:12:58.203
Go on.

190
00:12:58.433 --> 00:12:59.603
Fine.

191
00:13:01.272 --> 00:13:03.242
- See you. - Bye.

192
00:13:12.266 --> 00:13:17.266
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E32 Doubtful Victory "Come Back to the Team"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

193
00:13:26.803 --> 00:13:28.463
How are you going to take care of this?

194
00:13:30.772 --> 00:13:32.232
Did you get permission from my superior?

195
00:13:33.673 --> 00:13:36.543
But before that, what exactly did we do wrong?

196
00:13:36.543 --> 00:13:38.343
Gosh, you're so brazen.

197
00:13:38.772 --> 00:13:41.282
You've done so many things under our noses.

198
00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:45.313
Even a while ago, you helped Jang Pil Sung escape.

199
00:13:45.382 --> 00:13:47.482
And you stopped us from arresting him.

200
00:13:47.553 --> 00:13:48.882
So that's also obstruction of justice.

201
00:13:48.882 --> 00:13:52.193
We were just in a hurry to find Mr. Cha.

202
00:13:52.593 --> 00:13:55.022
That's why we accidentally bumped into you guys.

203
00:13:55.022 --> 00:13:58.762
On top of that, we looked for Mr. Cha together the entire day.

204
00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.732
We went through a lot of hardships together today.

205
00:14:01.732 --> 00:14:04.132
You can't betray us like this after all that we've done together.

206
00:14:04.132 --> 00:14:05.573
I don't care!

207
00:14:05.833 --> 00:14:09.002
You were all caught in the act, so let's wait and see.

208
00:14:09.343 --> 00:14:11.343
If the current chief of the NIS...

209
00:14:11.343 --> 00:14:14.543
will allow us to interrogate you or not.

210
00:14:14.612 --> 00:14:16.443
What if he doesn't?

211
00:14:16.443 --> 00:14:19.012
I'll say, "It's my mistake!"

212
00:14:19.152 --> 00:14:21.423
I'll apologize and let you go.

213
00:14:22.122 --> 00:14:25.492
Okay. Just undo this for me.

214
00:14:25.752 --> 00:14:27.563
We won't run away.

215
00:14:28.262 --> 00:14:29.293
Really?

216
00:14:33.902 --> 00:14:35.732
Did you think I would free you? Well?

217
00:14:36.632 --> 00:14:39.272
We're not stupid!

218
00:14:39.272 --> 00:14:40.343
Gosh.

219
00:14:47.443 --> 00:14:49.482
It stings.

220
00:14:56.482 --> 00:14:58.293
I heard you were in trouble.

221
00:14:58.553 --> 00:14:59.892
Inspector Park called me.

222
00:15:00.022 --> 00:15:02.793
What are you doing? I'm fine.

223
00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:04.362
Fine.

224
00:15:05.532 --> 00:15:06.603
Yes, you are.

225
00:15:08.803 --> 00:15:11.032
The problem is I lost Mr. Cha's notebook.

226
00:15:12.433 --> 00:15:14.002
We can just get it back.

227
00:15:14.502 --> 00:15:17.843
Jang Pil Sung will keep it instead of giving it to Manager Lee.

228
00:15:18.512 --> 00:15:20.642
He would never get rid of it.

229
00:15:20.742 --> 00:15:22.043
I know that.

230
00:15:22.043 --> 00:15:23.912
The problem is figuring out how to get it back.

231
00:15:25.412 --> 00:15:26.853
Your pizza is here.

232
00:15:27.353 --> 00:15:29.022
- Did you order pizza? - No.

233
00:15:32.652 --> 00:15:34.162
Eat it, and rest.

234
00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:35.992
We didn't order one.

235
00:15:35.992 --> 00:15:37.293
It's been paid for.

236
00:15:38.132 --> 00:15:39.193
Thank you.

237
00:15:39.193 --> 00:15:40.833
- Enjoy. - Okay.

238
00:15:40.902 --> 00:15:42.063
Who paid for it?

239
00:15:45.573 --> 00:15:46.642
What is this?

240
00:15:47.473 --> 00:15:49.173
Let's eat it while it's warm.

241
00:15:52.872 --> 00:15:53.882
Here.

242
00:16:00.083 --> 00:16:01.122
It's good.

243
00:16:03.152 --> 00:16:04.953
This reminds me of the past.

244
00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:08.593
You said you wanted to become a police officer while having pizza.

245
00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:09.622
You're wrong.

246
00:16:10.132 --> 00:16:13.162
We were eating pizza, and you told me to become one.

247
00:16:13.862 --> 00:16:14.902
Did I?

248
00:16:16.603 --> 00:16:19.532
Don't just eat, let's think about what we should do next.

249
00:16:20.402 --> 00:16:21.603
How are we going to get it back?

250
00:16:22.103 --> 00:16:25.412
Just wait. Jang Pil Sung will call.

251
00:16:25.412 --> 00:16:26.412
Who?

252
00:16:27.142 --> 00:16:29.213
- Me? - Either you or Lieutenant Jin.

253
00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:34.282
He's not someone who can ruin Lee Kwang Ho himself.

254
00:16:34.823 --> 00:16:37.992
He won't roam around forever as a wanted man either.

255
00:16:39.053 --> 00:16:40.463
Killing two birds with one stone?

256
00:16:41.193 --> 00:16:45.362
In exchange for the audio file and letting him become a free man,

257
00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:47.032
he would give us the notebook.

258
00:16:47.232 --> 00:16:49.502
We'll catch Lee Kwang Ho with it anyway.

259
00:16:49.502 --> 00:16:50.532
Yes.

260
00:16:51.303 --> 00:16:54.673
You have to decide how you will make a deal with him.

261
00:16:54.673 --> 00:16:55.703
I see.

262
00:17:05.513 --> 00:17:06.652
(Restricted Number)

263
00:17:13.922 --> 00:17:14.922
Yes?

264
00:17:16.833 --> 00:17:17.833
Jang Pil Sung?

265
00:17:22.402 --> 00:17:23.932
You look like you're well.

266
00:17:28.273 --> 00:17:31.273
I thought you wanted to kill me. Why did you want to meet?

267
00:17:31.642 --> 00:17:33.983
That's not what I ordered.

268
00:17:34.243 --> 00:17:37.853
I told him to make you suffer.

269
00:17:37.853 --> 00:17:41.152
However, some people seem to think...

270
00:17:41.152 --> 00:17:42.222
it means something else.

271
00:17:43.722 --> 00:17:46.222
- Why did you want to meet? - It's obvious.

272
00:17:46.763 --> 00:17:48.593
Make me a free man, and bring me the evidence.

273
00:17:50.033 --> 00:17:53.563
Jin Jung Gil's MP3 with the original file.

274
00:17:54.162 --> 00:17:56.932
Then, I will return Mr. Cha's notebook.

275
00:17:59.172 --> 00:18:01.103
I read the whole thing.

276
00:18:01.672 --> 00:18:06.212
It's a jackpot that perfectly encompasses Lee Kwang Ho's history.

277
00:18:08.013 --> 00:18:10.612
I'm not sure. It's only a record,

278
00:18:10.612 --> 00:18:12.652
and Mr. Cha disappeared.

279
00:18:13.253 --> 00:18:15.952
I don't know how strong of an evidence it'll be.

280
00:18:16.892 --> 00:18:19.222
He has Alzheimer's disease, so he can't testify either.

281
00:18:19.222 --> 00:18:22.122
Why do you think it's only a record?

282
00:18:23.063 --> 00:18:26.603
If you follow what's written on it, you'll find at least one clue.

283
00:18:27.902 --> 00:18:31.303
For example, a victim's bone.

284
00:18:35.202 --> 00:18:37.642
Well? Are you interested now?

285
00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:42.583
Then, go steal the MP3 player that has my neck on the line.

286
00:18:47.353 --> 00:18:48.583
Time and place?

287
00:18:51.622 --> 00:18:53.122
Exactly three hours later.

288
00:18:53.993 --> 00:18:55.063
Right here.

289
00:18:56.892 --> 00:18:58.662
We'll all bring what we promised.

290
00:18:59.662 --> 00:19:00.702
Are you in?

291
00:19:02.462 --> 00:19:03.503
I'm in.

292
00:19:27.323 --> 00:19:28.392
And?

293
00:19:29.993 --> 00:19:31.392
What are your thoughts?

294
00:19:32.263 --> 00:19:33.902
What you think is more important.

295
00:19:35.303 --> 00:19:38.132
We might risk freeing Jang Pil Sung for nothing.

296
00:19:39.702 --> 00:19:42.743
Where is the MP3 player my dad left behind?

297
00:19:44.172 --> 00:19:45.573
It's in my drawer.

298
00:19:45.843 --> 00:19:48.412
Jang Pil Sung ran away before I sent it to prosecution.

299
00:19:52.882 --> 00:19:54.222
It'll work out, right?

300
00:19:55.823 --> 00:19:56.952
It must.

301
00:19:59.222 --> 00:20:01.763
If you don't want to, we don't have to do it.

302
00:20:02.962 --> 00:20:03.962
Hold on.

303
00:20:16.642 --> 00:20:18.773
- Let them go. - What?

304
00:20:18.942 --> 00:20:20.912
The chief declined.

305
00:20:23.353 --> 00:20:24.513
Really?

306
00:20:24.612 --> 00:20:27.053
Why are you asking him? It's just as we expected.

307
00:20:27.053 --> 00:20:28.253
Undo me.

308
00:20:34.523 --> 00:20:36.122
I'm going to make an official complaint.

309
00:20:36.122 --> 00:20:38.833
Go ahead. We don't care.

310
00:20:38.833 --> 00:20:40.202
Get out of here.

311
00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:42.803
We're really tired and busy today.

312
00:20:47.442 --> 00:20:48.503
What?

313
00:20:49.372 --> 00:20:51.212
Bye.

314
00:20:57.412 --> 00:20:58.952
Did something happen?

315
00:20:59.513 --> 00:21:02.353
Oh Il Seung is going to make a deal with Jang Pil Sung.

316
00:21:02.983 --> 00:21:04.823
He'll give Pil Sung Chairman Jin's MP3 player...

317
00:21:04.823 --> 00:21:06.593
in exchange for Mr. Cha's notes.

318
00:21:06.823 --> 00:21:08.063
No way.

319
00:21:09.422 --> 00:21:11.962
They're meeting in two hours at Manjong Parking Lot.

320
00:21:11.962 --> 00:21:15.733
We'll go with Officer Oh to meet Jang Pil Sung, so get ready.

321
00:21:16.063 --> 00:21:17.172
Hey.

322
00:21:19.233 --> 00:21:23.273
Wouldn't it be a disadvantage to the chairwoman if he gets caught?

323
00:21:23.273 --> 00:21:26.442
Yes. Should we get him out?

324
00:21:26.442 --> 00:21:27.442
Yes.

325
00:21:28.712 --> 00:21:29.743
Let's go.

326
00:21:30.283 --> 00:21:31.313
(Interrogation Room)

327
00:21:34.083 --> 00:21:35.283
Exchange what?

328
00:21:36.122 --> 00:21:37.722
What is in Mr. Cha's notebook?

329
00:21:38.793 --> 00:21:40.922
Well, I'm not exactly sure.

330
00:21:41.222 --> 00:21:42.763
but it's probably a record of things.

331
00:21:49.003 --> 00:21:50.972
Mr. Cha, that jerk.

332
00:21:51.902 --> 00:21:54.243
If you would allow me, I will take care of it.

333
00:21:54.743 --> 00:21:56.843
- Get Jang Pil Sung too. - Yes, sir.

334
00:22:08.952 --> 00:22:11.753
You must be desperate to arrest Lee Kwang Ho.

335
00:22:12.093 --> 00:22:15.323
You know I can tell the difference between a real and a fake, right?

336
00:22:26.942 --> 00:22:27.972
It's the right one.

337
00:22:35.112 --> 00:22:37.483
What is this? Hey.

338
00:22:38.283 --> 00:22:40.722
You have the wrong person.

339
00:22:43.182 --> 00:22:44.222
Hey.

340
00:22:44.392 --> 00:22:45.652
Hey.

341
00:23:12.253 --> 00:23:13.422
It's a misunderstanding.

342
00:23:13.922 --> 00:23:15.983
- I... - Shut your mouth.

343
00:23:20.692 --> 00:23:21.793
Let me ask you again.

344
00:23:22.993 --> 00:23:23.993
Is this all?

345
00:23:24.993 --> 00:23:26.132
Of course.

346
00:23:27.202 --> 00:23:28.462
I can promise you.

347
00:23:30.103 --> 00:23:33.472
Manager Lee, it's not what you think.

348
00:23:33.472 --> 00:23:35.202
Don't you dare joke with me.

349
00:23:37.442 --> 00:23:39.573
(November 29, 2007, Gahoe-dong 904-2)

350
00:23:39.573 --> 00:23:42.843
You're saying, Mr. Cha's notebook...

351
00:23:43.212 --> 00:23:44.912
has things like this in it?

352
00:23:44.912 --> 00:23:47.882
Yes. Like I told you, that notebook...

353
00:23:48.023 --> 00:23:49.382
is currently with Jang Pil Sung.

354
00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:53.152
How can we get it back? It's Jang Pil Sung we're up against.

355
00:23:53.152 --> 00:23:56.222
We can get Jang Pil Sung along with Lee Kwang Ho.

356
00:23:56.563 --> 00:23:57.563
Both of them?

357
00:23:58.233 --> 00:23:59.293
How?

358
00:24:03.932 --> 00:24:06.642
We'll let Lee Kwang Ho's side find out...

359
00:24:06.642 --> 00:24:09.872
that Jang Pil Sung wants to make a deal with us.

360
00:24:10.612 --> 00:24:13.013
We'll leak the exact time and place too.

361
00:24:13.743 --> 00:24:16.013
They're meeting in two hours at Manjong Parking Lot.

362
00:24:16.013 --> 00:24:18.353
We'll go with Officer Oh to meet Jang Pil Sung,

363
00:24:18.912 --> 00:24:20.083
so get ready.

364
00:24:20.422 --> 00:24:21.483
Okay.

365
00:24:22.283 --> 00:24:23.793
Then, they'll send men.

366
00:24:24.053 --> 00:24:25.753
Because they need to intercept the notebook...

367
00:24:26.493 --> 00:24:27.892
and get Jang Pil Sung.

368
00:24:28.222 --> 00:24:31.093
Once Lee Kwang Ho abducts Jang Pil Sung,

369
00:24:31.093 --> 00:24:34.402
he'll try to get rid of the notebook and kill Jang Pil Sung.

370
00:24:34.402 --> 00:24:36.362
We'll break in as soon as we record it.

371
00:24:36.773 --> 00:24:39.202
We'll catch both Jang Pil Sung and Lee Kwang Ho.

372
00:24:40.303 --> 00:24:42.172
How will we record them?

373
00:24:42.402 --> 00:24:45.412
Jang Pil Sung wouldn't volunteer to take a recorder.

374
00:24:46.372 --> 00:24:48.083
Chairman Jin's MP3 player.

375
00:24:49.513 --> 00:24:51.853
We'll wiretap it.

376
00:24:51.853 --> 00:24:55.083
Yes. Once we give it to Jang Pil Sung,

377
00:24:55.222 --> 00:24:58.192
he would never throw it out even if he gets caught.

378
00:25:01.122 --> 00:25:03.632
Then, the bug will get really close to Lee Kwang Ho.

379
00:25:04.833 --> 00:25:06.033
The MP3 player too.

380
00:25:11.073 --> 00:25:13.202
If you don't feel right, we don't have to do it.

381
00:25:14.273 --> 00:25:15.273
Hold on.

382
00:25:16.172 --> 00:25:17.972
Are you sure this is everything?

383
00:25:18.672 --> 00:25:19.712
Yes.

384
00:25:20.313 --> 00:25:21.382
Search him.

385
00:25:22.612 --> 00:25:24.253
This won't work.

386
00:25:24.253 --> 00:25:26.152
Let's at least get Jang Pil Sung. Let's go.

387
00:25:26.152 --> 00:25:27.182
- Okay. - Okay.

388
00:25:42.162 --> 00:25:43.303
What is this?

389
00:25:52.013 --> 00:25:53.073
That?

390
00:25:54.813 --> 00:25:55.912
That's...

391
00:25:59.853 --> 00:26:01.983
- Hey! - Let go!

392
00:26:03.452 --> 00:26:04.823
Move back.

393
00:26:05.553 --> 00:26:07.692
Wait outside, and leave the gates open.

394
00:26:07.993 --> 00:26:09.093
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

395
00:26:19.303 --> 00:26:21.503
We would appreciate your cooperation.

396
00:26:24.073 --> 00:26:25.813
We have an arrest warrant for Jang Pil Sung.

397
00:26:28.642 --> 00:26:29.712
Take him away.

398
00:26:46.432 --> 00:26:47.603
Who are you?

399
00:26:49.202 --> 00:26:51.303
Get out!

400
00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:53.702
Congressman, I'm here!

401
00:26:54.472 --> 00:26:55.573
Don't worry.

402
00:26:56.573 --> 00:26:58.642
I will protect you!

403
00:27:02.882 --> 00:27:04.083
Get him.

404
00:27:04.212 --> 00:27:05.212
Hey!

405
00:27:10.593 --> 00:27:11.922
Jang Pil Sung!

406
00:27:16.833 --> 00:27:18.063
No.

407
00:27:45.753 --> 00:27:46.862
(He ordered me to murder.)

408
00:27:53.603 --> 00:27:54.603
What's wrong?

409
00:27:57.103 --> 00:27:58.872
The person Mr. Cha killed...

410
00:28:03.942 --> 00:28:05.043
is my mother.

411
00:28:15.182 --> 00:28:19.093
Congressman Lee Kwang Ho ordered me to murder...

412
00:28:19.093 --> 00:28:22.362
a mother and a son who doesn't have a place to live.

413
00:28:22.962 --> 00:28:24.033
The woman's name is...

414
00:28:24.033 --> 00:28:25.263
"The woman's name is..."

415
00:28:25.462 --> 00:28:26.862
- Choi... - "Choi..."

416
00:28:26.862 --> 00:28:28.132
- Yeon... - "Yeon..."

417
00:28:28.132 --> 00:28:29.533
- Mi. - "Mi".

418
00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:34.503
Mom.

419
00:28:35.103 --> 00:28:36.103
Mom!

420
00:28:36.912 --> 00:28:38.972
Mom! Mom!

421
00:28:39.472 --> 00:28:42.182
Mom! Mom!

422
00:28:42.912 --> 00:28:44.983
Mom, wake up.

423
00:28:48.523 --> 00:28:50.023
Mom!

424
00:28:50.452 --> 00:28:53.593
Mom. Wake up, Mom.

425
00:28:55.023 --> 00:28:56.533
Mom.
