Why have you been
acting that way?

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.920 line:93%
Well...

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:36.689 line:93%
Please go.
Go quickly.

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:39.289 line:93%
Can't a boss and his
assistant leave together?

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.329 line:93%
That's not it. I...

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.660 line:93%
Did you do something
wrong?

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.499 line:93%
Will someone
come and get you?

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.440 line:93%
You've been acting anxious
the whole day.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.779 line:93%
Why are you so restless?

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.450 line:93%
The thing is...

(Living in the same house)

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.310 line:93%
Right? She had a scandal
last time too.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.510 line:93%
You're right.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.519 line:93%
Guys, did you see this?

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:38.879 line:93%
- Yes.
- I did.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.790 line:93%
- She's such a disgrace.
- It must be true.

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:44.760 line:93%
She and her last boss were
involved in a scandal too.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.859 line:93%
They're together.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.329 line:93%
- Is that her?
- She's such a witch.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.659 line:93%
Isn't that the woman
from last time?

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.129 line:93%
She was kicked out
for the same thing.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:54.829 line:93%
It is her.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.900 line:93%
She was in a scandal
with Mr. Bong.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.239 line:93%
- They're together.
- She's at it again.

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:00.639 line:93%
She's such a witch.

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:02.570 line:93%
Will she get kicked out
this time?

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.210 line:93%
What a piece of work.

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:08.109 line:93%
Are you all right?

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.250 line:93%
Don't mind them. Let's go.

What's wrong?

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.470 line:93%
Are you okay?

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200 line:93%
Are you...

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.369 line:93%
Yoon Yi!

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.589 line:93%
Yoon Yi!

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.359 line:93%
Yoon Yi.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.530 line:93%
Don't come.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.989 line:93%
Don't come close.

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:04.559 line:93%
I just...

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.769 line:93%
I just want to be alone.

Yoon Yi, open the door.

00:04:33.859 --> 00:04:34.989 line:93%
Yoon Yi.

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.299 line:93%
Yoon Yi, open the door.

Thank you.

You're six minutes late.

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:24.640 line:93%
- I paid him extra...
- I don't care.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.640 line:93%
Open it.

I'm so honored...

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.449 line:93%
that I can be of help.

I'm sure YB Group could
use a talent like me.

Yes. Move.

- Okay.

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:43.859 line:93%
Go.

Wait, my resume...

00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:17.160 line:93%
Do you
still want to be alone?

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.170 line:93%
All right.

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:30.679 line:93%
I'm innocent.

00:06:35.109 --> 00:06:36.449 line:93%
I'm innocent.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.819 line:93%
I'm so upset.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.220 line:93%
Why do such scandals
always say...

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.259 line:93%
that the assistant
seduced the boss?

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.689 line:93%
They don't know
anything about it,

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:51.730 line:93%
but they give me
such dirty looks.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.569 line:93%
Why are they saying
I have to quit?

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.939 line:93%
Who says you have to quit?

00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:06.580 line:93%
That won't happen.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.480 line:93%
You're wrong.

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:12.790 line:93%
The company
will only choose you.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.890 line:93%
I've been through it
before.

00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:21.059 line:93%
But I'm on your side.

00:07:21.429 --> 00:07:23.530 line:93%
I can't work
without my assistant.

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:27.270 line:93%
You're the one
that helps me...

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.170 line:93%
be a good boss.

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:33.109 line:93%
That's why I would never
let you go.

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:38.879 line:93%
Other assistants...

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:42.049 line:93%
can work just like me.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.220 line:93%
You pay a lot of attention
to others.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.689 line:93%
You also get your nose
in everything.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.359 line:93%
You make people laugh,

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:00.970 line:93%
and you're warm
to be around.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.640 line:93%
I'm jealous of you
for being like that.

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:11.509 line:93%
If I can help it,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.549 line:93%
I want to be someone
like you.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.049 line:93%
So, why would I
send you away?

00:08:21.489 --> 00:08:22.660 line:93%
For whom?

00:08:23.359 --> 00:08:24.359 line:93%
Don't you agree?

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.629 line:93%
In which comic book...

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.400 line:93%
did you find this quote?

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.439 line:93%
It's a secret.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.640 line:93%
I won't...

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.280 line:93%
hide behind you.

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:47.250 line:93%
I'll fight against them.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.209 line:93%
I didn't
do anything wrong.

00:08:49.719 --> 00:08:51.750 line:93%
I'll stay strong.
I'll be myself.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.390 line:93%
Let's go. Let's go.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.520 line:93%
Let's go.

00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:30.890 line:93%
I thought
you were leaving early.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.990 line:93%
I woke up late.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:34.890 line:93%
I see.

00:09:35.589 --> 00:09:38.360 line:93%
It's snowing so much.

00:09:38.699 --> 00:09:42.270 line:93%
I thought it might be
too bright out,

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.839 line:93%
but it's not.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.740 line:93%
It's a perfect day
for a fight.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.140 line:93%
Let's be cheerful.

00:09:51.709 --> 00:09:52.750 line:93%
Let's go.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.410 line:93%
Okay.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.069 line:93%
Don't be so nervous.

00:10:14.969 --> 00:10:17.040 line:93%
People will
forget everything...

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.099 line:93%
in a few days.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.309 line:93%
If we tell them the truth,

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.839 line:93%
we can make things right.

00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:26.209 line:93%
Okay.

00:10:38.459 --> 00:10:40.660 line:93%
Chin up.
Stand up straight.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.559 line:93%
Look forward,
and be confident.

00:10:44.929 --> 00:10:46.170 line:93%
Let's go.

00:11:29.209 --> 00:11:32.179 line:93%
Gosh. Are you okay?
Come this way.

00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:41.319 line:93%
Did all of you
get the call?

00:11:41.689 --> 00:11:42.760 line:93%
We'll be interviewed
for screening.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.559 line:93%
It has finally
come to this.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.990 line:93%
There is no secret
in this world.

00:11:47.729 --> 00:11:49.860 line:93%
Are you saying
all of you knew?

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.429 line:93%
That's not important.

00:11:52.099 --> 00:11:53.729 line:93%
What do we do now?

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.000 line:93%
What if one of them
is asked...

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.870 line:93%
- to change departments?
- It's probably...

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.610 line:93%
Yoon Yi who will leave.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.240 line:93%
No! Not Yoon Yi.

00:12:03.309 --> 00:12:04.339 line:93%
I won't let her go.

00:12:04.579 --> 00:12:06.479 line:93%
Who are you to say that?

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:08.010 line:93%
Did you know too?

00:12:09.449 --> 00:12:11.979 line:93%
Since it came to this,
I better come clean.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.420 line:93%
I'll protect Yoon Yi.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.030 line:93%
Yoon Yi and I...

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.370 line:93%
(Interview at 10am
regarding posting)

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.660 line:93%
You're saying the man
she dated a long time...

00:12:55.229 --> 00:12:56.400 line:93%
was you?

00:12:57.329 --> 00:12:59.429 line:93%
- Yes.
- Was it a fling...

00:12:59.429 --> 00:13:00.530 line:93%
with Mr. Nam?

00:13:00.929 --> 00:13:01.929 line:93%
Exactly.

00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:07.309 line:93%
Are you crazy?

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.209 line:93%
Are you shooting a drama?
Is this a set? Cut.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.309 line:93%
- Good work.
- Thank you.

00:13:12.309 --> 00:13:13.880 line:93%
Your acting is getting
better. Hey!

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.049 line:93%
Hey.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.620 line:93%
How can her new
and old boyfriends...

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.750 line:93%
be in one department?
On top of that,

00:13:21.819 --> 00:13:24.319 line:93%
in this
kind of relationship?

00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:27.559 line:93%
That must mean Mr. Nam...

00:13:27.729 --> 00:13:30.630 line:93%
was jealous of you
and that's why...

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.170 line:93%
he sent you on
business trips.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.540 line:93%
- Yes.
- Is that so?

00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:40.309 line:93%
Hey, you should
become a writer.

00:13:40.339 --> 00:13:42.339 line:93%
You could write
an office romantic comedy.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.110 line:93%
I'll watch your drama.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.490 line:93%
What's wrong with them?
Why won't they believe me?

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.360 line:93%
I have the family register
and the rental agreement.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.400 line:93%
I included all
the documents you need.

00:14:07.299 --> 00:14:09.030 line:93%
I'm legally divorced,

00:14:09.229 --> 00:14:11.770 line:93%
and I'm a tenant
at my assistant's house.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.540 line:93%
That's not a fact.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.740 line:93%
Mr. Bong and I were
never in a relationship.

00:14:21.209 --> 00:14:22.510 line:93%
But now...

00:14:23.049 --> 00:14:24.179 line:93%
That's right.

00:14:24.579 --> 00:14:27.049 line:93%
Ms. Jwa and I are dating.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.219 line:93%
If you think...

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.290 line:93%
we shouldn't be working
in the same department,

00:14:34.929 --> 00:14:36.059 line:93%
then...

00:14:38.229 --> 00:14:39.569 line:93%
I will accept a transfer.

00:14:39.929 --> 00:14:42.500 line:93%
However, we won't
go on the waitlist...

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:44.740 line:93%
or accept a request
to resign.

00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:04.120 line:93%
You dropped it in my car
last night.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.559 line:93%
Thank you.

00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:12.199 line:93%
Also, for driving me home
yesterday.

00:15:18.939 --> 00:15:20.110 line:93%
What is it?

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.780 line:93%
What about the files
for the meeting?

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:24.610 line:93%
Right.

00:15:24.809 --> 00:15:27.709 line:93%
It's ready. You can
leave around 1pm.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.199 line:93%
(My sister Mi Ae)

00:15:51.439 --> 00:15:53.339 line:93%
Are you sure
that's the person...

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.610 line:93%
who wrote the posting on
our corporate bulletin...

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.439 line:93%
at 6:37pm yesterday?

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.880 line:93%
Yes.

00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:05.719 line:93%
Okay. I got it.

00:16:08.349 --> 00:16:09.420 line:93%
Sir?

00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:14.559 line:93%
Here is the list
of broadcast material.

00:16:16.929 --> 00:16:20.130 line:93%
Whoever wrote it
planned it through.

00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:23.299 line:93%
I asked IT
to track the IP address.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.010 line:93%
It was a laptop of someone
who quit yesterday.

00:16:29.809 --> 00:16:33.209 line:93%
Can you think of anyone
around Mr. Cho?

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.280 line:93%
No.

00:16:37.349 --> 00:16:39.819 line:93%
They even posted
our selfies.

00:16:40.049 --> 00:16:42.920 line:93%
They must have stolen it
from one of our phones.

00:16:44.059 --> 00:16:46.390 line:93%
Did you ever
lose your phone...

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.729 line:93%
or lend it to someone?

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.959 line:93%
Not at all.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.130 line:93%
I always keep it...

00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:55.229 line:93%
Hey, Yoon Yi.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.140 line:93%
I'm out of battery.
Can I borrow your phone?

00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:02.370 line:93%
We're going
our separate ways.

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:07.579 line:93%
I will only think about
myself from now.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.249 line:93%
- What's wrong?
- Pardon?

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.489 line:93%
It's nothing.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.600 line:93%
You're so smart.

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:28.070 line:93%
I don't care who has
what degree.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:31.739 line:93%
You're so talented.
Ma Bo Na is the best.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.080 line:93%
What will happen
to the two of them?

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.749 line:93%
They will split apart
for sure.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.380 line:93%
Nam Chi Won won't be
able to reform or report.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.050 line:93%
It's the end for him.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.489 line:93%
I better take this chance
to pull him down.

00:17:51.219 --> 00:17:53.489 line:93%
As for Jwa Yoon Yi...

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:56.999 line:93%
What do you want me to do?

00:17:59.729 --> 00:18:01.870 line:93%
I'll do
whatever you ask me.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.009 line:93%
A departmental transfer
will do.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:09.979 line:93%
That's it?

00:18:11.939 --> 00:18:14.650 line:93%
Sure. I'll consider it.

00:18:19.449 --> 00:18:21.420 line:93%
I will grind them
to a pulp.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.090 line:93%
What?

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.959 line:93%
The person who leaked
the pictures.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.160 line:93%
If I find out who it is,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.929 line:93%
I will grind them in the
blender and drink it up.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.769 line:93%
If they were able
to get to the selfies,

00:18:38.769 --> 00:18:41.070 line:93%
they must be someone
really close.

00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:43.979 line:93%
Could it be someone
from her office?

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.880 line:93%
Has she never
lost her phone?

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.550 line:93%
We can ask her now.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.969 line:93%
Are you all right?

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.939 line:93%
I heard you were
interviewed.

00:19:11.939 --> 00:19:13.009 line:93%
How did it go?

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.939 line:93%
You're not being put on
waitlist again, are you?

00:19:17.509 --> 00:19:19.479 line:93%
It'll take a few days
for them to decide.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.590 line:93%
Hey, Bo Na.

00:19:28.989 --> 00:19:31.189 line:93%
- Yes?
- Did you know?

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.689 line:93%
- Know what?
- That Mr. Cho did it.

00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:43.739 line:93%
Are you sure it's him?

00:19:43.739 --> 00:19:45.939 line:93%
There is
only one person...

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.239 line:93%
who would
do such a thing...

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.779 line:93%
to me or Mr. Nam.

00:19:51.739 --> 00:19:53.910 line:93%
So?
Why are you telling me?

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.350 line:93%
Because
you're his assistant.

00:19:56.979 --> 00:19:58.350 line:93%
I thought
you might know something.

00:19:58.519 --> 00:19:59.920 line:93%
Guys.

00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:02.019 line:93%
Why do you
keep doing this?

00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:04.860 line:93%
Just be honest with me.

00:20:06.489 --> 00:20:08.529 line:93%
Are you suspicious of me?

00:20:08.729 --> 00:20:09.759 line:93%
Yes.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.830 line:93%
It bothers me
that you borrowed...

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:14.929 line:93%
my phone
a few days ago.

00:20:15.939 --> 00:20:16.969 line:93%
Yoon Yi.

00:20:16.969 --> 00:20:19.610 line:93%
You should check
your transfer records.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.410 line:93%
Hey, hey, hey!

00:20:24.439 --> 00:20:26.249 line:93%
You guys are driving me
crazy.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.479 line:93%
What's wrong with you?

00:20:29.009 --> 00:20:31.820 line:93%
If you're so suspicious,
get someone...

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.249 line:93%
professional
to check for you.

00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:37.489 line:93%
Seriously.

00:20:37.719 --> 00:20:39.060 line:93%
I'm begging you.

00:20:39.689 --> 00:20:42.390 line:93%
Let's not do this
among friends.

00:20:45.729 --> 00:20:47.029 line:93%
What if it proves it?

00:20:49.199 --> 00:20:50.199 line:93%
What?

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.170 line:93%
What if it proves
it was Bo Na?

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.509 line:93%
Then what?

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.110 line:93%
That's why I can't do it.

00:21:02.509 --> 00:21:04.949 line:93%
In case it proves what
I don't want to believe.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.519 line:93%
I'm too afraid to.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.840 line:93%
What is this?

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.650 line:93%
It's information on your
89th personal assistant.

00:21:40.489 --> 00:21:42.449 line:93%
I said not to do this
anymore.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.719 line:93%
It's information
you need to know.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.229 line:93%
I'll take care of it,

00:21:48.759 --> 00:21:49.759 line:93%
so leave.

00:21:50.529 --> 00:21:52.029 line:93%
You should act soon,

00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:53.929 line:93%
- before the adults...
- Get out!

00:22:23.999 --> 00:22:25.029 line:93%
Sir.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.400 line:93%
The meeting may run long.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.939 line:93%
Wouldn't it be better
to have lunch first?

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.810 line:93%
The timing
is a bit awkward.

00:22:37.009 --> 00:22:38.209 line:93%
I'm not hungry.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.110 line:93%
Okay.

00:22:56.229 --> 00:22:57.429 line:93%
Jung Ae!

00:23:17.179 --> 00:23:18.380 line:93%
What happened?

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.620 line:93%
Why weren't you
picking up?

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.090 line:93%
- How long has it been?
- Why are you...

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.519 line:93%
- Wow.
- Jung Ae!

00:23:23.519 --> 00:23:24.590 line:93%
I've missed you.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.090 line:93%
You got prettier.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:29.999 line:93%
Do you know her?

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.560 line:93%
Sorry?

00:23:32.499 --> 00:23:33.600 line:93%
Well...

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.400 line:93%
No.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.340 line:93%
Life in the US
must be good.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.850 line:93%
Hey! What's wrong
with you?

00:23:48.449 --> 00:23:51.219 line:93%
Shoot. Hey.
You should be in Chicago.

00:23:51.219 --> 00:23:52.719 line:93%
Why are you here?

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.150 line:93%
What about my sister?

00:23:54.189 --> 00:23:55.890 line:93%
Why is she here?

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.759 line:93%
I can't stand this
anymore.

00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:03.330 line:93%
Hey. Calm down
and listen to me.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.370 line:93%
About the trip
to Hong Kong...

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:13.370 line:93%
Yes?

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.140 line:93%
Go with me.

00:24:16.979 --> 00:24:20.110 line:93%
Sorry? Me?

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.979 line:93%
Yes. You have a passport,
right?

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.350 line:93%
A passport.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.749 line:93%
Well... But...
The thing is...

00:24:29.689 --> 00:24:31.320 line:93%
I have...

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.330 line:93%
a lot of work to get done
next week,

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.459 line:93%
and I have some important
matters at home,

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.670 line:93%
so I can't...

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.130 line:93%
Are those
the only reasons...

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:43.870 line:93%
why you can't go?

00:24:44.739 --> 00:24:45.739 line:93%
Sorry?

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.610 line:93%
Well... Yes.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.890 line:93%
Get out.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.029 line:93%
Sir.

00:25:54.009 --> 00:25:56.310 line:93%
I guess everyone's out
for lunch.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:22.900 line:93%
Sir.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.640 line:93%
It's lunch time.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.239 line:93%
Is it already?

00:26:27.239 --> 00:26:29.340 line:93%
Yes. What would you like?

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.539 line:93%
I'll go out and pick up
a sandwich or...

00:26:31.539 --> 00:26:33.449 line:93%
- Hey.
- Come in.

00:26:33.449 --> 00:26:34.679 line:93%
Ta-da!

00:26:34.679 --> 00:26:36.019 line:93%
We brought lunch!

00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:37.120 line:93%
Ta-da!

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.320 line:93%
- Look!
- You didn't eat, right?

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.620 line:93%
Eat with us.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:42.820 line:93%
Okay.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.719 line:93%
What are you doing?
Come join us.

00:26:44.719 --> 00:26:46.259 line:93%
Yoon Yi, you too.

00:26:46.259 --> 00:26:47.630 line:93%
- Sit.
- Eat.

00:26:49.429 --> 00:26:50.860 line:93%
These are fruits.

00:26:52.199 --> 00:26:53.499 line:93%
Here.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.410 line:93%
What...

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.640 line:93%
How nice.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.410 line:93%
- Seriously.
- Gosh.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.479 line:93%
This place...

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:10.779 line:93%
is famous for selling
only one per person,

00:27:10.779 --> 00:27:12.989 line:93%
but we wanted to get one
for each of you.

00:27:12.989 --> 00:27:15.590 line:93%
It turns out, the owner
likes Song Dae Kwan.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.920 line:93%
So I did this for him.
"I'm in a good mood."

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.029 line:93%
"How do you feel?"

00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:24.330 line:93%
Then, he went, "Take it!"

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.130 line:93%
So, I did.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.600 line:93%
- Let's eat, please.
- Okay, okay.

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.370 line:93%
Thank you.

00:27:31.699 --> 00:27:32.769 line:93%
Yoon Yi.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.870 line:93%
Yours is bulgogi,
your favorite.

00:27:37.439 --> 00:27:38.439 line:93%
You didn't know, right?

00:27:40.009 --> 00:27:41.179 line:93%
Remember it.

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:48.150 line:93%
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.929 line:93%
But...

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.100 line:93%
did you all know about us?

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.529 line:93%
I...

00:28:01.529 --> 00:28:03.439 line:93%
- I knew first!
- I could tell...

00:28:03.439 --> 00:28:05.199 line:93%
- You were so obvious!
- Of course!

00:28:05.199 --> 00:28:06.810 line:93%
- Totally.
- Goodness.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.439 line:93%
- I knew...
- You were...

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:14.910 line:93%
This is the Year
of the Golden Dog.

00:28:15.479 --> 00:28:18.679 line:93%
Among those in YB born
in the Year of the Dog,

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.019 line:93%
Mr. Nam
is the most senior.

00:28:21.249 --> 00:28:23.289 line:93%
He met Jwa Yoon Yi,
who brought fortune,

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:25.590 line:93%
and became successful.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:27.330 line:93%
Thus,

00:28:27.989 --> 00:28:32.300 line:93%
our department's
performance shot up!

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:37.840 line:93%
Our MD increased
my body temperature.

00:28:38.969 --> 00:28:40.310 line:93%
He acts cold,

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.269 line:93%
but he's super warm
on the inside.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:45.509 line:93%
Have you ever received
thermals from your boss?

00:28:45.709 --> 00:28:46.810 line:93%
I have.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.449 line:93%
They're crazy warm.

00:28:50.249 --> 00:28:52.550 line:93%
Did they show
inappropriate PDA?

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.090 line:93%
Are they having an affair?

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:56.820 line:93%
You won't ask something
so tasteless, will you?

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.630 line:93%
Is dating a coworker
a crime?

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:04.100 line:93%
If you ask if Mr. Nam
did something wrong,

00:29:04.959 --> 00:29:06.600 line:93%
it was only
that he loved a woman,

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.640 line:93%
and that woman loved him
shamelessly.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:15.469 line:93%
Simply put, our department
is filled with love.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.610 line:93%
The video department...

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:22.550 line:93%
- is love!
- Is love!

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.949 line:93%
It's nice eating together.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.289 line:93%
It tastes better.

00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:31.289 line:93%
Right?

00:29:31.289 --> 00:29:33.330 line:93%
What did you decide
to do about him?

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.560 line:93%
Don't ask.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.160 line:93%
I shouldn't have asked!

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.800 line:93%
I'm sorry!

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.170 line:93%
Show us Song Dae Kwan
selling meat.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.640 line:93%
- Sure.
- No!

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.410 line:93%
You have no idea
how good this is.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:52.910 line:93%
Tell us about the raccoon.
Whose idea was it?

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.009 line:93%
- That's right.
- We all saw it!

00:29:55.009 --> 00:29:56.479 line:93%
Right?

00:29:56.479 --> 00:29:58.949 line:93%
- Yes. Tell us!
- We saw it!

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.600 line:93%
Sir. Mr. Cho Sang Moo and
some executives are here.

00:30:25.624 --> 00:30:30.624 line:93%

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.620 line:93%
Sir.

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:42.489 line:93%
We must make Nam Chi Won
step down as head...

00:30:42.489 --> 00:30:44.229 line:93%
of the video department.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.830 line:93%
His scandal...

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.229 line:93%
has spread beyond
the walls of YB,

00:30:49.229 --> 00:30:51.469 line:93%
and is spreading
even globally.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.670 line:93%
One little worm
is damaging...

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.239 line:93%
YB's image...

00:30:56.239 --> 00:30:59.779 line:93%
The ethics committee
hasn't decided yet,

00:31:00.479 --> 00:31:02.509 line:93%
and we don't know
what his intentions are.

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:05.350 line:93%
Don't be so rash.

00:31:05.479 --> 00:31:08.820 line:93%
You keep letting
your personal feelings...

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.320 line:93%
interfere and...

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.870 line:93%
This is a petition by
the executives...

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.340 line:93%
requesting Nam Chi Won's
dismissal.

00:31:28.039 --> 00:31:31.009 line:93%
(Nam Chi Won's dismissal
is requested.)

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.050 line:93%
(Cho Sang Moo,
Kim Tae Gon, Moon Min Ho)

00:31:40.249 --> 00:31:44.320 line:93%
(YB Group Reorganization)

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.459 line:93%
What do you mean?
Mi Ae came to the office?

00:31:47.759 --> 00:31:48.989 line:93%
Yes.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.160 line:93%
Right when I was with
Mr. Hwangbo, too.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.429 line:93%
Where is she now?

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.340 line:93%
Kyung Rye took her home.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:00.840 line:93%
What do I do?
I'm so scared.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.979 line:93%
I feel like
Mr. Hwangbo knows.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.249 line:93%
The way he looks at and
talks to me is different.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:09.550 line:93%
You need to calm down.

00:32:10.479 --> 00:32:13.519 line:93%
Let's all gather at your
place and discuss this.

00:32:13.949 --> 00:32:15.120 line:93%
Okay.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.090 line:93%
Yoon Yi. The VP is here.
We need to go.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:19.689 line:93%
Hurry.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.060 line:93%
Just a minute.

00:32:47.189 --> 00:32:49.019 line:93%
You sit too, Yoon Yi.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.769 line:93%
You must be
very stressed.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.640 line:93%
No, sir. I'm fine.

00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:11.039 line:93%
Aren't you sick of seeing
him at work and at home?

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:14.979 line:93%
Say what you came to say.

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:21.749 line:93%
I think...

00:33:23.489 --> 00:33:24.689 line:93%
the two of you...

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:27.989 line:93%
should split up
for the time being.

00:33:30.429 --> 00:33:32.969 line:93%
We'll wait for the ethics
committee's decision,

00:33:32.969 --> 00:33:34.570 line:93%
but move out of the house.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.140 line:93%
Why? I did nothing wrong.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.170 line:93%
There's way too much
attention on you two.

00:33:40.239 --> 00:33:41.769 line:93%
Just until
things calm down.

00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:44.509 line:93%
Think of it as
you're avoiding a shower.

00:33:45.979 --> 00:33:48.209 line:93%
You told me before
to face things head-on.

00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:50.880 line:93%
Now, you're telling me
to avoid it?

00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:52.689 line:93%
Chi Won.

00:34:36.329 --> 00:34:37.400 line:93%
Yoon Yi.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.829 line:93%
- I think I...
- You'll move out?

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:44.539 line:93%
Yes. I think I should.

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:47.970 line:93%
You told Mr. Do
that you wouldn't.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:50.809 line:93%
You were so confident.
Why are you saying this?

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:54.880 line:93%
I thought it over,

00:34:55.849 --> 00:34:57.349 line:93%
and he was right.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:03.420 line:93%
You think on your own
and decide as you wish.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.159 line:93%
You're just...

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:08.959 line:93%
giving me notice.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.829 line:93%
It's not like that.

00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:14.170 line:93%
You said you'd protect me.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:16.639 line:93%
You said you'd stay
by my side.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.470 line:93%
I'm hanging on because of
that one promise,

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.970 line:93%
but you had
a change of heart?

00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:25.809 line:93%
No. Don't go.
I don't want you to.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.680 line:93%
I don't want
to be afraid alone again.

00:35:28.479 --> 00:35:29.749 line:93%
This time,

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.019 line:93%
it isn't about
just the two of us.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.150 line:93%
What?

00:35:36.459 --> 00:35:38.360 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.110 line:93%
Dissolution?

00:35:53.269 --> 00:35:54.970 line:93%
It came down from
headquarters.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.950 line:93%
The departments will get
the notice soon.

00:36:01.249 --> 00:36:04.720 line:93%
You know the executives
are upset about...

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.450 line:93%
the whistleblowing project
you proposed, right?

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.689 line:93%
But now, with this
adding to it,

00:36:09.789 --> 00:36:11.360 line:93%
you gave them a good
excuse...

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.090 line:93%
to take down
the video department.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:18.630 line:93%
Are you saying you'll
get rid of our department?

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.269 line:93%
Either that,

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:25.039 line:93%
or I'm sure someone
will try to absorb it.

00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:32.139 line:93%
You were overwhelmed
with our problem already.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:36.550 line:93%
I didn't want to add on
another source of stress.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:38.050 line:93%
Mr. Nam.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.519 line:93%
I'm a member of
the video department...

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:45.019 line:93%
before
I'm your girlfriend.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.389 line:93%
How could you make me
an immature...

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:50.999 line:93%
whiny girl
who knows nothing?

00:36:51.559 --> 00:36:53.130 line:93%
Had I known...

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.639 line:93%
Let's go.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.209 line:93%
Pack emergency medicine.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.939 line:93%
It may get cold,
so pack thermals too.

00:37:05.539 --> 00:37:08.709 line:93%
You'll need a thick
jacket too.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.050 line:93%
I think your luggage
is too small.

00:37:14.249 --> 00:37:15.689 line:93%
Do you have a bigger one?

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:19.220 line:93%
Why? Are you sending me
away for good?

00:37:22.059 --> 00:37:24.030 line:93%
Leave me your key
when you go.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.900 line:93%
If I miss you
or get bored or something,

00:37:27.369 --> 00:37:29.400 line:93%
I'll come up
and read some comic books.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.400 line:93%
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.240 line:93%
Aren't you hungry?

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.579 line:93%
Want some ramyeon?

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.189 line:93%
Wait. I'll light that.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:51.889 line:93%
Step back.

00:37:54.659 --> 00:37:55.829 line:93%
Careful.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.769 line:93%
Careful.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.840 line:93%
I can handle this much.

00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:10.110 line:93%
I react differently
depending on how I feel,

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.249 line:93%
but when I'm with
a certain someone,

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:15.880 line:93%
I always feel good.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:23.619 line:93%
What?

00:38:24.059 --> 00:38:25.720 line:93%
Whatever.

00:38:28.829 --> 00:38:31.099 line:93%
Hurry up and make ramyeon.

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:04.559 line:93%
You don't have any bowls.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.130 line:93%
I couldn't do the dishes.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:08.999 line:93%
Let's just eat
from the pot.

00:39:12.709 --> 00:39:14.010 line:93%
It looks good.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:17.340 line:93%
I never expected to eat
ramyeon that you make.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.409 line:93%
Thank you.

00:39:21.849 --> 00:39:22.979 line:93%
Enjoy.

00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:24.619 line:93%
Thanks.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.110 line:93%
Go in. It's cold.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:27.749 line:93%
I'll see you off.

00:40:27.849 --> 00:40:29.820 line:93%
I don't want you
to see me leave.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:32.650 line:93%
Go inside.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.220 line:93%
You have plans
with your friends.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.829 line:93%
Go eat and drink,

00:40:40.959 --> 00:40:42.430 line:93%
and cheer up.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.829 line:93%
Call me
when you get there.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.530 line:93%
Call before you go to bed
and when you wake up.

00:41:26.809 --> 00:41:27.840 line:93%
Sure.

00:41:29.639 --> 00:41:31.979 line:93%
He'll be back anyway.

00:41:54.269 --> 00:41:55.430 line:93%
Hello.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:21.490 line:93%
Hey.

00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:24.999 line:93%
What are you doing here?

00:42:25.099 --> 00:42:26.099 line:93%
You said to come.

00:42:26.099 --> 00:42:29.439 line:93%
You don't come
just because I ask you to.

00:42:32.039 --> 00:42:33.070 line:93%
I was...

00:42:33.809 --> 00:42:35.039 line:93%
in the area,

00:42:36.439 --> 00:42:37.939 line:93%
and I had time to kill.

00:42:38.709 --> 00:42:39.709 line:93%
I owe you...

00:42:40.209 --> 00:42:42.249 line:93%
for singing to me too.

00:42:44.979 --> 00:42:46.889 line:93%
You came to me...

00:42:47.689 --> 00:42:49.519 line:93%
instead of playing with
Gapsoon?

00:42:49.959 --> 00:42:51.420 line:93%
Is that it, Gapdol?

00:42:54.659 --> 00:42:55.659 line:93%
Chi Won.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.530 line:93%
How much...

00:42:59.729 --> 00:43:01.769 line:93%
do you trust Gapsoon?

00:43:04.099 --> 00:43:06.510 line:93%
Why do you ask?

00:43:06.769 --> 00:43:08.010 line:93%
You know,

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.110 line:93%
for me,

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.280 line:93%
I'm scared
that the person...

00:43:15.979 --> 00:43:17.180 line:93%
that I trust...

00:43:19.019 --> 00:43:21.289 line:93%
really isn't who
that person is.

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:24.189 line:93%
It scares me.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.030 line:93%
I always thought that
person was on my side,

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.170 line:93%
and believed that person
was on my side,

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.639 line:93%
so the thought that
I was wrong...

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:42.780 line:93%
angers me.

00:43:47.849 --> 00:43:49.079 line:93%
I thought you had
a good eye.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.680 line:93%
But you can't tell...

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.990 line:93%
whether someone is
on your side or not?

00:43:58.090 --> 00:43:59.189 line:93%
You're right.

00:43:59.959 --> 00:44:01.329 line:93%
Trusting someone...

00:44:02.659 --> 00:44:04.700 line:93%
regardless of
all of that...

00:44:04.999 --> 00:44:06.369 line:93%
is true faith.

00:44:08.769 --> 00:44:10.139 line:93%
Regardless...

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:13.170 line:93%
of all of that?

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.650 line:93%
Sorry, Mi Ae.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.880 line:93%
Even if...

00:44:24.979 --> 00:44:27.650 line:93%
you had no choice because
of that jerk husband,

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:30.559 line:93%
how could you fake your
identity to get a job?

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.389 line:93%
As a corporate heir's
personal assistant, too?

00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:37.260 line:93%
Gun Woo will hear.

00:44:38.059 --> 00:44:40.030 line:93%
At least you know
you should be ashamed.

00:44:41.269 --> 00:44:42.269 line:93%
That's enough.

00:44:44.139 --> 00:44:47.409 line:93%
Sure, you're too naive
to know anything.

00:44:48.409 --> 00:44:49.709 line:93%
What about you guys?

00:44:49.909 --> 00:44:51.380 line:93%
You should've stopped her,

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.680 line:93%
but one instigated it, and
the others played along.

00:44:58.479 --> 00:45:00.189 line:93%
What if...

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:01.519 line:93%
we get caught?

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.360 line:93%
What happens to her?

00:45:03.519 --> 00:45:04.920 line:93%
You study law in the US,

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.189 line:93%
so you should know better.

00:45:06.659 --> 00:45:08.289 line:93%
You may go to jail...

00:45:08.459 --> 00:45:09.959 line:93%
for forging documents...

00:45:10.159 --> 00:45:12.030 line:93%
and tortious interference.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.670 line:93%
The same goes for you,
Yoon Yi.

00:45:14.729 --> 00:45:15.729 line:93%
What?

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.439 line:93%
Then what do we do?

00:45:19.909 --> 00:45:21.939 line:93%
What if we get caught?

00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:24.780 line:93%
Should we just
come clean...

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.050 line:93%
and ask for forgiveness?

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:31.550 line:93%
I will...

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:34.820 line:93%
not forgive anyone!

00:45:35.189 --> 00:45:38.059 line:93%
Why are they doing this
to me?

00:45:38.059 --> 00:45:41.490 line:93%
I will... You know...
Destroy you all.

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:42.630 line:93%
Destroy them.

00:45:44.159 --> 00:45:45.760 line:93%
Shoot.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.369 line:93%
What a nice place.

00:45:50.939 --> 00:45:52.139 line:93%
It's nice being rich.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.340 line:93%
Chi Won.

00:45:59.479 --> 00:46:01.280 line:93%
Don't go.

00:46:03.079 --> 00:46:05.579 line:93%
Live with me.

00:46:11.459 --> 00:46:13.130 line:93%
Did you unpack?

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:15.030 line:93%
Pretty much.

00:46:15.729 --> 00:46:17.459 line:93%
Where are you?

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.070 line:93%
At a guest house.

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:22.670 line:93%
A very fancy...

00:46:23.369 --> 00:46:24.400 line:93%
traditional Korean house.

00:46:27.769 --> 00:46:30.180 line:93%
My boyfriend is so rich.

00:46:32.079 --> 00:46:34.579 line:93%
You sound dejected.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:36.479 line:93%
Am I imagining that?

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.420 line:93%
It's because...

00:46:40.249 --> 00:46:42.519 line:93%
Mr. Nitpick
isn't upstairs.

00:46:43.159 --> 00:46:45.860 line:93%
We've been apart for
less than half a day.

00:46:46.159 --> 00:46:47.329 line:93%
I know.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:51.729 line:93%
Why does half a day
feel so long?

00:46:52.159 --> 00:46:53.400 line:93%
You must be tired.

00:46:54.099 --> 00:46:55.269 line:93%
Go to sleep.

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.700 line:93%
Okay.

00:46:58.269 --> 00:46:59.510 line:93%
Good night.

00:47:25.659 --> 00:47:30.570 line:93%
(Forging documents,
tortious interference)

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:36.409 line:93%
Oh, no.

00:47:38.439 --> 00:47:39.880 line:93%
I'm losing my mind.

00:47:40.579 --> 00:47:42.579 line:93%
Why do these bombs...

00:47:42.579 --> 00:47:45.380 line:93%
keep going off
left and right like this?

00:47:45.749 --> 00:47:48.289 line:93%
I'm seriously
losing my mind.

00:47:48.289 --> 00:47:50.519 line:93%
People can't find out.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.530 line:93%
No, they can't.
They can't.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.329 line:93%
Mr. Nam hates it
the most...

00:47:58.059 --> 00:48:00.900 line:93%
when people lie.

00:48:01.499 --> 00:48:05.269 line:93%
What do I do?

00:48:06.909 --> 00:48:07.909 line:93%
Okay.

00:48:09.479 --> 00:48:11.409 line:93%
Let's get some cold air...

00:48:12.039 --> 00:48:13.209 line:93%
and wake up.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:15.550 line:93%
Wake up...

00:48:22.019 --> 00:48:23.119 line:93%
Mr. Nam?

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.200 line:93%
I'm not a hallucination.
I'm real.

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:40.369 line:93%
You're real.

00:48:42.269 --> 00:48:44.039 line:93%
You came back already?

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.240 line:93%
No.

00:48:46.249 --> 00:48:47.479 line:93%
I just missed you.

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.050 line:93%
It hasn't been that long
since you left.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.959 line:93%
What if I had no idea
and fell asleep?

00:48:55.959 --> 00:48:58.789 line:93%
What would you have done?

00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:59.789 line:93%
What?

00:49:00.229 --> 00:49:01.829 line:93%
You said you couldn't
sleep without me.

00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:04.159 line:93%
- Were you lying?
- No.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.269 line:93%
What do I do?

00:49:07.769 --> 00:49:09.340 line:93%
I don't think...

00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:11.599 line:93%
I'll ever sleep again.

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:14.510 line:93%
Oh, no.

00:49:15.709 --> 00:49:18.209 line:93%
I can't come over
every day.

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:22.979 line:93%
Then?

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.630 line:93%
Look at the stars.

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.530 line:93%
There are so many stars.

00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:43.139 line:93%
You're right.

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:44.570 line:93%
How pretty.

00:50:30.019 --> 00:50:31.380 line:93%
What the...

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.619 line:93%
My gosh.

00:50:33.249 --> 00:50:34.990 line:93%
What's wrong with you?

00:50:36.159 --> 00:50:37.260 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:46.630 line:93%
Let's have breakfast.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.439 line:93%
You said
you wanted to eat.

00:50:52.499 --> 00:50:54.610 line:93%
Exactly.
Someone needs to cook.

00:50:54.809 --> 00:50:56.579 line:93%
Who? Me?

00:50:56.579 --> 00:50:57.939 line:93%
Should the landlord cook?

00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:05.280 line:93%
What a feast.

00:51:08.349 --> 00:51:09.590 line:93%
Thank you for the food.

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.159 line:93%
You eat up too!

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:23.439 line:93%
You're going to make me
throw up. Stop that.

00:51:40.749 --> 00:51:41.849 line:93%
It's yummy.

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:44.659 line:93%
How does canned food
taste so good?

00:51:45.019 --> 00:51:46.459 line:93%
Are you bipolar?

00:51:46.959 --> 00:51:48.829 line:93%
You were depressed
just yesterday.

00:51:52.559 --> 00:51:53.599 line:93%
What's wrong?

00:51:54.099 --> 00:51:55.130 line:93%
Chi Won.

00:51:56.539 --> 00:51:57.740 line:93%
I'm scared...

00:51:59.409 --> 00:52:01.409 line:93%
that the person I trust...

00:52:02.209 --> 00:52:05.039 line:93%
isn't really who
that person is.

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:07.550 line:93%
Is terrifies me.

00:52:08.209 --> 00:52:10.650 line:93%
Let's eat first.
Let's eat.

00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:23.829 line:93%
What is it?

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.999 line:93%
Tuna.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.880 line:93%
It's nice coming to work
with you.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:41.050 line:93%
Isn't it?

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.700 line:93%
On our way home, let's
stop by the supermarket.

00:52:58.459 --> 00:53:01.099 line:93%
I'm craving braised
pollack. Make it for me.

00:53:02.639 --> 00:53:04.400 line:93%
That's enough already.

00:53:04.869 --> 00:53:06.439 line:93%
Are you living together?

00:53:06.769 --> 00:53:09.639 line:93%
We are.
We're living together.

00:53:11.079 --> 00:53:13.050 line:93%
- You are?
- Yes, we are.

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:17.150 line:93%
I guess living with people
is your thing.

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:21.749 line:93%
It's better than digging
up dirt on people.

00:53:22.659 --> 00:53:26.590 line:93%
You should give up trying
to dig up dirt on people.

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:28.189 line:93%
This is a warning.

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:32.869 line:93%
I warned you first,

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.570 line:93%
not to mess with Yoon Yi.

00:53:36.939 --> 00:53:38.670 line:93%
Don't you know you get
ejected...

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:39.970 line:93%
if you break a rule
after a warning?

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:41.240 line:93%
I know, you punk.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:44.110 line:93%
Shall we see
who gets ejected first?

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:51.780 line:93%
This is so much fun!
It's better than a drama!

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:01.659 line:93%
Darn it. I want to know
how it ends.

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:03.059 line:93%
Okay.

00:54:03.959 --> 00:54:05.300 line:93%
Please continue next time.

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:11.139 line:93%
That little psycho.

00:54:11.499 --> 00:54:14.769 line:93%
He's always late to work
because of the dramas.

00:54:23.579 --> 00:54:24.920 line:93%
It's even nicer seeing you
today.

00:54:26.619 --> 00:54:27.920 line:93%
Sir.

00:54:29.249 --> 00:54:32.019 line:93%
There was a company-wide
notice today.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.559 line:93%
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:54:37.159 --> 00:54:39.059 line:93%
Our department
will be safe, right?

00:54:39.329 --> 00:54:40.970 line:93%
Of course.

00:54:41.269 --> 00:54:43.869 line:93%
The video department
became solidified...

00:54:43.869 --> 00:54:45.539 line:93%
when they scouted Mr. Nam.

00:54:45.539 --> 00:54:48.909 line:93%
The problem is evaluations
are based on performance.

00:54:48.909 --> 00:54:51.240 line:93%
We're low on the totem
pole in performance.

00:54:51.979 --> 00:54:54.349 line:93%
Intra-company videos can't
be evaluated like that.

00:54:54.479 --> 00:54:56.920 line:93%
It's the subsidiaries'
means of communication.

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:00.550 line:93%
That worries me too.

00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:04.889 line:93%
Mr. Cho is dying to
take down our department.

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.389 line:93%
He won't miss
this opportunity.

00:55:11.959 --> 00:55:13.499 line:93%
Let's get ready.
You're here.

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:18.939 line:93%
Get ready.

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:20.570 line:93%
Okay.

00:55:27.579 --> 00:55:30.249 line:93%
(YB Group Reorganization)

00:55:33.389 --> 00:55:35.189 line:93%
My life is finally...

00:55:35.189 --> 00:55:37.420 line:93%
seeing some sunlight.

00:55:38.059 --> 00:55:40.990 line:93%
I'll have to use this
to eat up...

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:42.389 line:93%
the video department
whole.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.170 line:93%
This is a report on
the video department's...

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:48.900 line:93%
performance over
the past three years.

00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:52.909 line:93%
Our department and theirs
overlapped a lot,

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:55.439 line:93%
so it'll probably be easy
to merge the two.

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:59.139 line:93%
Good. This is so good.

00:56:03.079 --> 00:56:06.550 line:93%
Finally, the big picture
that I've been drawing...

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:08.019 line:93%
is coming together.

00:56:13.659 --> 00:56:17.159 line:93%
If our department wants
to survive reorganization,

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:21.700 line:93%
we must prove our worth
on our own.

00:56:22.369 --> 00:56:25.499 line:93%
That's why we must
make sure...

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:28.470 line:93%
the whistleblowing project
becomes a success.

00:56:28.939 --> 00:56:32.280 line:93%
If you look at complaints
made about YB,

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:37.420 line:93%
unfair work distribution
is the more prevalent.

00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:40.990 line:93%
Among all the departments,
it is the worst...

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:42.720 line:93%
in Advertisement Planning.

00:56:42.889 --> 00:56:44.689 line:93%
Our first episode
will be...

00:56:45.019 --> 00:56:47.860 line:93%
unfair work distribution
in Ad Planning.

00:56:50.059 --> 00:56:51.159 line:93%
Let's get to it.

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:03.880 line:93%
Trusting someone...

00:57:05.309 --> 00:57:08.809 line:93%
regardless of
all of that is true faith.

00:57:19.189 --> 00:57:20.360 line:93%
Sir.

00:57:20.689 --> 00:57:23.800 line:93%
This fax came
from Hong Kong.

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.269 line:93%
Ms. Wang.

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:28.900 line:93%
- Yes?
- Isn't there...

00:57:30.099 --> 00:57:31.869 line:93%
something you want
to tell me?

00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:37.139 line:93%
Something you need to
tell me, but couldn't...

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:38.909 line:93%
because of
certain circumstances.

00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:43.979 line:93%
What if we get caught?

00:57:44.849 --> 00:57:46.189 line:93%
What happens to her?

00:57:46.889 --> 00:57:49.990 line:93%
You may go to jail
for forging documents...

00:57:50.389 --> 00:57:52.159 line:93%
and tortious interference.

00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:58.999 line:93%
No, sir. There isn't.

00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:05.740 line:93%
I'll get going then.

00:58:15.409 --> 00:58:17.950 line:93%

Wang Jung Ae.

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:35.599 line:93%
Who...

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:39.610 line:93%
are you?

00:58:43.579 --> 00:58:46.280 line:93%
Our department
will be okay, right?

00:58:47.749 --> 00:58:49.010 line:93%
We'll make it that way.

00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:55.090 line:93%
I can't think straight
lately.

00:58:55.959 --> 00:58:58.320 line:93%
With the ethics committee
and the reorganization...

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.090 line:93%
and...

00:59:01.959 --> 00:59:02.959 line:93%
And?

00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.570 line:93%
Your tenant moving out?

00:59:11.499 --> 00:59:12.670 line:93%
Let's eat...

00:59:13.039 --> 00:59:15.939 line:93%
something so delicious
that your runaway brain...

00:59:16.209 --> 00:59:17.809 line:93%
will come right home.

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:20.409 line:93%
Okay.

00:59:26.749 --> 00:59:28.320 line:93%
- Mr. Nam.
- Yes?

00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:29.760 line:93%
Just a minute.

00:59:42.869 --> 00:59:44.599 line:93%
You don't mind
the cameras anymore?

00:59:48.709 --> 00:59:49.780 line:93%
It's okay now.

01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:28.550 line:93%
(Epilogue)

(Epilogue)

01:00:33.519 --> 01:00:34.650 line:93%
What is this?

01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:36.420 line:93%
I'm feeding and housing
you for free.

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.659 line:93%
You should do
at least this much.

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:41.159 line:93%
Notice to Lodger.

01:00:56.409 --> 01:00:59.709 line:93%
You shall wear the same
outfit as the owner.

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:03.849 line:93%
You shall play games
with the owner...

01:01:03.849 --> 01:01:05.550 line:93%
for at least three hours
a day.

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:10.360 line:93%
You shall perform
basic housekeeping duties.

01:01:15.389 --> 01:01:16.900 line:93%
Were you unable
to sleep again...

01:01:17.059 --> 01:01:18.159 line:93%
because I wasn't there?

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.700 line:93%
Yes.

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:23.170 line:93%
Sing me a lullaby.

01:01:28.209 --> 01:01:33.380 line:93%
When the mom
goes to the sea

01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:39.950 line:93%
To catch oysters

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:47.590 line:93%
The baby stays home alone

01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:54.930 line:93%
And watches the house

01:01:57.099 --> 01:02:02.269 line:93%
Then the lullaby
that the sea sings

01:02:04.209 --> 01:02:09.749 line:93%
Puts the baby to sleep

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:17.420 line:93%
The baby falls asleep

01:02:20.159 --> 01:02:25.930 line:93%

(Jugglers)

01:02:40.909 --> 01:02:42.749 line:93%
Why don't you win over
the employees...

01:02:42.749 --> 01:02:43.979 line:93%
in preparation?

01:02:43.979 --> 01:02:45.380 line:93%
A working mom.

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.119 line:93%
Would it be better for us
to merge with Ad Planning?

01:02:48.119 --> 01:02:50.490 line:93%
Stop talking like our
department will be gone.

01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:52.519 line:93%
I asked who you were.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:53.990 line:93%
Why did you bring her
to me?

01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:55.360 line:93%
Why?

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.599 line:93%
When you return
to being my assistant,

01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.400 line:93%
wear these and run to me.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.930 line:93%
Maybe I shouldn't have
bought her shoes.

01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:02.840 line:93%
What if she never
comes back?

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.539 line:93%
The final department that
will be dissolved is...
