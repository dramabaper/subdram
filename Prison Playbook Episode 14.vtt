Subtitles by Jeong@Netflix 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.680 line:93%
Excuse me, Crony.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.350 line:93%
You're in my way, so go over there.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.980 line:93%
Hey!

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.820 line:93%
Dong-ho, sit over there.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.780 line:93%
I'll call you if I need...

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.330 line:93%
Hey, Je-hyeok!

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.830 line:93%
I heard you signed with Nexen.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.750 line:93%
Drinks are on you.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.720 line:93%
Aren't you cold?

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.970 line:93%
Can you not feel the cold?

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.480 line:93%
Your lawyer said they gave you
good money and a multi-year contract.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.650 line:93%
Wow. That's great.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.400 line:93%
Nexen is really generous.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.280 line:93%
-Is it because you're a franchise player?
-Yeah.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160 line:93%
Ji-ho. What about her?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.370 line:93%
Oh, Ji-ho?

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.460 line:93%
She's going to come visit next week.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.870 line:93%
She's really coming?

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.340 line:93%
It's exam week.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.800 line:93%
She said she'll come once she's done.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.220 line:93%
Wow. Ji-ho is so generous. Seriously.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.510 line:93%
When you see her, give her a big hug.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.230 line:93%
No, I'll hug her instead.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.020 line:93%
No. I'll ask Je-hee to hug her.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.900 line:93%
Geez.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.450 line:93%
You seem really happy lately.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.530 line:93%
-Me?
-I guess

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.120 line:93%
your relationship is going well.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.040 line:93%
No. I'm just happy
because things are going well for you.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.130 line:93%
Then will you please let go of my arm?

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.720 line:93%
Did you put on cologne?

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.060 line:93%
You did.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.860 line:93%
This punk is an animal.
He can smell things like a dog.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.900 line:93%
Who is this woman

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.160 line:93%
that's making the biggest player
try so hard?

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.080 line:93%
A "player"?

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.790 line:93%
You have me completely wrong.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.880 line:93%
I'm not like that.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.670 line:93%
I'm a very sincere and faithful man.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.430 line:93%
Je-hyeok.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.640 line:93%
Even if everyone else thinks that,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.480 line:93%
you can't, Je-hyeok.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.900 line:93%
Okay?

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.410 line:93%
I'm not tired at all. I'm used to it now.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.040 line:93%
Let's have brunch. I'll come to you.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.960 line:93%
What should we have?

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.420 line:93%
<i>Anything.</i>

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.590 line:93%
<i>But you should go home and sleep.</i>

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.390 line:93%
<i>You must've just finished
your night shift.</i>

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.890 line:93%
I can always sleep later.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.350 line:93%
Want to go to Garosugil?
Want to get brunch there?

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.400 line:93%
How about udon? I know a good place.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.730 line:93%
There's a place famous on Instagram.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.190 line:93%
It's a pasta place,
but they have only one table.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.320 line:93%
I hear it's incredibly good.
Should we go there?

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.410 line:93%
We probably can't.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.120 line:93%
They're always booked,
so I guess we can't go for a while.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.920 line:93%
<i>-They must do well.
</i>-Totally.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.380 line:93%
They take reservations online
only at 7 a.m.,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.130 line:93%
and they get booked up in one second.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.590 line:93%
You have to click like crazy.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.220 line:93%
<i>Really? It must be really good.</i>

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.310 line:93%
<i>I do want to try it, though.</i>

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.980 line:93%
You do? Okay.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.830 line:93%
Joon-ho, wake up!

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.000 line:93%
Joon-ho! You need to be alert!

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.720 line:93%
Five seconds.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.100 line:93%
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.110 line:93%
Fail. Fail for this one too.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.030 line:93%
Fail.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.740 line:93%
Success.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.080 line:93%
-Success?
-Success?

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.540 line:93%
-Success!
-Success!

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.460 line:93%
Success!

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.960 line:93%
RESERVATION COMPLETED.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.960 line:93%
You did it!

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.520 line:93%
PRISON PLAYBOOK

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.610 line:93%
Congratulations.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.290 line:93%
Gosh.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.710 line:93%
It's good news.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:33.920 line:93%
What's wrong with you?

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.970 line:93%
<i>If he was chosen for parole,
it's 90% likely he'll get it.</i>

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.560 line:93%
He served over 80% of his sentence,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.310 line:93%
was a model inmate
and never caused trouble,

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.440 line:93%
so the officers probably gave him
high scores.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.020 line:93%
Then he'll pass for sure.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.070 line:93%
How many years did Min-chul serve?

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.860 line:93%
Initially execution,
reduced to life in prison,

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.030 line:93%
reduced to 25 years 10 years ago.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.200 line:93%
Currently serving his 22nd year.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.410 line:93%
I've been learning about the inmates.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.620 line:93%
His was the hardest to memorize.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.540 line:93%
This is hard too.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.630 line:93%
Look at him. Look. He isn't human.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.930 line:93%
When will we find out?

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.430 line:93%
They submitted it last week,

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.390 line:93%
so, in two to three weeks.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.520 line:93%
It takes about 30 days
to get a decision on parole.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.520 line:93%
You know absolutely everything.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.650 line:93%
This is why experience is important.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.940 line:93%
It's more smarts than experience.
I'm pretty smart.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.240 line:93%
I mean it.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.780 line:93%
If I were born into a wealthy family
and studied,

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.120 line:93%
I probably would've gone
to the same university as him.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.580 line:93%
Hey. Why is he always here?

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.790 line:93%
Captain Yoo said something harsh.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.920 line:93%
His feelings were hurt.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.380 line:93%
What did he say?

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.630 line:93%
He wouldn't be dejected like that
unless it was something really harsh.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.130 line:93%
I know.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.030 line:93%
Aren't you watching?

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.240 line:93%
I memorized all of <i>Screening Humanity</i>.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.370 line:93%
I watched that episode on the 10 siblings
living in the woods over 20 times.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.250 line:93%
I'm sure today, it'll end with the 7th kid
going sledding with the 8th kid,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.960 line:93%
and tripping over a rock.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.790 line:93%
I see.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.840 line:93%
Han-yang, Jung-woo.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.130 line:93%
There are some business ideas
that I came up with

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.300 line:93%
while spending all those years here.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.050 line:93%
Want to hear them?

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.600 line:93%
The first idea is...

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.060 line:93%
Min-chul, let's talk.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.100 line:93%
Me?

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.730 line:93%
Is there a problem with the parole?

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.690 line:93%
-Was it rejected?
-No.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.320 line:93%
That's for the higher-ups to figure out.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.910 line:93%
I said not to worry.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.580 line:93%
There's no reason for you not to get it.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.040 line:93%
I need to talk to you alone. Come out.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:19.870 line:93%
Yes, sir.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.010 line:93%
Hey, kindergartners. Don't fight. Be good.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.430 line:93%
If you fight away,
this mister will spank you.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.420 line:93%
I'm really sick, that's why.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.170 line:93%
Will your body rot if I sleep on your lap?

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.350 line:93%
Do you hate me that much? Huh?

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.430 line:93%
It's uncomfortable.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.270 line:93%
How you use drugs as an excuse
to be touchy with people

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.730 line:93%
makes me uncomfortable.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.950 line:93%
You know, don't you?

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.620 line:93%
Yes.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.340 line:93%
Do you...

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.550 line:93%
hate that?

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.970 line:93%
I can't understand.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.890 line:93%
I won't judge,

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.190 line:93%
but I can't understand.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.820 line:93%
If someone close to me was like that,

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.900 line:93%
I would've punched him.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.010 line:93%
Whatever. What do I care?

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.130 line:93%
Hey.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.600 line:93%
If you're going to come here every day,
clean a little.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.810 line:93%
Don't just bum around.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.600 line:93%
Do you hate me too?

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.560 line:93%
Naturally. Who likes druggies?

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.320 line:93%
Druggies are the biggest repeat offenders.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.530 line:93%
It's impossible to fix.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.750 line:93%
But you will.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.250 line:93%
You didn't take any drugs
for months, right?

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.840 line:93%
You didn't take any, right?

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.130 line:93%
Then the finish line is in sight.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.680 line:93%
You're getting out in a month too.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.600 line:93%
Hang in there until then.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.140 line:93%
Go into rehab as soon as you get out,
and get therapy.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.520 line:93%
Okay.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.400 line:93%
Why did you start taking drugs?
You're normal enough.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.320 line:93%
How did you end up getting into drugs?

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.860 line:93%
When I was studying in Japan.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:45.040 line:93%
Ji-won and I were broken up for a bit,
and I was very lonely and depressed.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.000 line:93%
There was a classmate of mine

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.000 line:93%
who was like a total hippie.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.340 line:93%
<i>He said it would be okay
if I did it just once.</i>

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.090 line:93%
2015 TOKYO, JAPAN

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.930 line:93%
<i>I drank it in seconds.</i>

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.390 line:93%
<i>I wasn't thinking.</i>

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.480 line:93%
I did it that one time that day for fun,

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:58.820 line:93%
but later on, I found myself dealing them.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.660 line:93%
So you should never ever take drugs, okay?

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:06.910 line:93%
Okay?

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.580 line:93%
-Okay, I won't.
-Good.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.090 line:93%
-Joon-ho.
-Yeah?

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.460 line:93%
Can I really get better?

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.720 line:93%
I can get better.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.010 line:93%
Of course, I can get better.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.180 line:93%
I will never,

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.100 line:93%
ever take drugs again.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.980 line:93%
Psycho. He answers his own questions.
What does he want from me?

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.820 line:93%
-Joon-ho.
-What now?

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.940 line:93%
What's wrong with Je-hyeok's pitches?

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.660 line:93%
The balls are just like me.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.580 line:93%
They're all over the place.
They're out of control.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.630 line:93%
I've been watching this whole time,

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.210 line:93%
and he can't throw a single strike.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.990 line:93%
An interview? Me?

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.080 line:93%
Yeah. It's her senior thesis,
and it's about long-term inmates.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.790 line:93%
She says she really wants to
interview you.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.750 line:93%
You don't have to do it.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.210 line:93%
-I'll do it.
-Really?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.050 line:93%
I need to start practicing meeting people.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.100 line:93%
And who knows?

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.930 line:93%
Doing this interview

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.230 line:93%
may help with my parole decision.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.690 line:93%
Okay. Visitations will be
permitted again soon,

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.190 line:93%
so I'll set a date.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.610 line:93%
Lieutenant Paeng, can we talk?

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.700 line:93%
Me? Why?

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.280 line:93%
It'll be a minute.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.490 line:93%
You're scaring me. What is it?

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.870 line:93%
It's Steve Blass disease.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.960 line:93%
What's that?

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.840 line:93%
I just told you.
It's the inability to throw strikes.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.800 line:93%
That's not good.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.260 line:93%
That's why it's a problem.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.550 line:93%
So, I wanted to ask you for a favor.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.560 line:93%
He can just throw strikes.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.680 line:93%
No, he can't.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.060 line:93%
-Why not?
-It's Steve Blass disease.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.270 line:93%
-What is that?
-Are you stupid?

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.310 line:93%
What?

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.770 line:93%
<i>There is no reason or cause,</i>

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.990 line:93%
<i>which is why it's harder to fix.</i>

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.030 line:93%
<i>It's usually predominantly psychological.</i>

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.280 line:93%
<i>Like feeling pressured</i>

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.910 line:93%
<i>or stressed about doing well.
That's the most common.</i>

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.040 line:93%
What a strange thing it is. Of all the...

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.130 line:93%
We had one on my squad.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.340 line:93%
He was a golfer, but suddenly
got the yips, was it?

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.180 line:93%
He suddenly got the yips
and couldn't fix it,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.300 line:93%
and gave up on golf and enlisted.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.970 line:93%
He couldn't putt as he used to.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.940 line:93%
Must you say that right now
in this situation?

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.770 line:93%
-Are you a sicko?
-It's psychological.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.440 line:93%
You should get therapy.

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.990 line:93%
He's ignoring me, right?

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.110 line:93%
Yes, he is.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.750 line:93%
He found a team,

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.000 line:93%
and things are working out
with his girlfriend,

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.210 line:93%
so he just has to play baseball well.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.720 line:93%
-But it caused stress instead.
-Does he need surgery?

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.430 line:93%
No. It's due to stress.
Why would he need surgery?

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.850 line:93%
I'm asking because I don't know.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.390 line:93%
Can't you read between the lines?

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.100 line:93%
No! I'm not a baseball player!
How would I know?

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.190 line:93%
I just explained it to you!

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.820 line:93%
Do you get everything
that's been explained to you?

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.530 line:93%
Why not? Like this is so damn hard?

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:10.820 line:93%
Even a dog would understand!

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.200 line:93%
What? What did you just say?

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.280 line:93%
Hey!

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.290 line:93%
Why not? Like this is so damn hard?

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.580 line:93%
Even a dog would understand!

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.960 line:93%
What? What did you just say?

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.040 line:93%
Hey!

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.840 line:93%
Stand closer. Then you'll hear each other.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.260 line:93%
Geez.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.300 line:93%
Lieutenant Paeng. What's the code

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.760 line:93%
for the drawer
in the administration office?

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.850 line:93%
Three, six, eighteen.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.360 line:93%
Wow. What a great code.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.360 line:93%
Also,

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.940 line:93%
please don't fight.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.200 line:93%
We can hear you in there.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.160 line:93%
If you fight again,

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.500 line:93%
I'll put both of you in the hole.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.500 line:93%
We plan to get expert help.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.260 line:93%
He's under your command,
so if you give your approval,

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.130 line:93%
we'll start tomorrow
in the new inmate training room.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.720 line:93%
Of course,

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.010 line:93%
-Captain Na can't...
-Captain Na can't...

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.600 line:93%
He can't know.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.020 line:93%
-Thank you.
-Gosh.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.070 line:93%
Why are the hardships never-ending
for Je-hyeok?

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.400 line:93%
It's never-ending.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.700 line:93%
I thought he could finally
just focus on baseball now, but...

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.460 line:93%
Is God sending cues from up there?

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.840 line:93%
As soon as one hardship is over,
he sends him another.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.050 line:93%
He won't leave that poor human alone.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.470 line:93%
Poor Je-hyeok.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.220 line:93%
I wonder if he can handle this.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.770 line:93%
He must be exhausted.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.380 line:93%
Je-hyeok.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.760 line:93%
Can we talk for a minute?

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.940 line:93%
I looked into some options.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.190 line:93%
Let's start tomorrow, okay?

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.190 line:93%
There's a way, right?

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.650 line:93%
Of course. There are many.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.240 line:93%
I'll fix it.
There's nothing that can't be fixed.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.280 line:93%
-Of course.
-Of course.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.410 line:93%
I'll do anything. I can't give up now
after what I've been through.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.410 line:93%
I'll do anything. Anything.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.550 line:93%
Je-hyeok is amazing.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.520 line:93%
I would've given up on baseball long ago.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.810 line:93%
It'll be hard to cure Steve Blass.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.400 line:93%
There must be a way, right?

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.730 line:93%
Cell 6. Exercise time.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:46.830 line:93%
Are they the gangsters?

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.870 line:93%
Don't drop it! Shit!

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:57.460 line:93%
Yes. They have that one boss.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.470 line:93%
The stupid-looking thug is his henchman.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.510 line:93%
The jerk that looks like a scumbag
is the druggie.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.600 line:93%
You druggie.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.010 line:93%
They're the worst.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.180 line:93%
They'll go after anyone
if they smell money.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.810 line:93%
They have an errand boy.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.190 line:93%
He's the soda.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.570 line:93%
Set menus always come with a soda.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:20.070 line:93%
You're right. They need an errand boy
to roam as they please.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.240 line:93%
Plus, he's got the keys.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.330 line:93%
That jerk is no joke.
There's nothing he can't get.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:29.250 line:93%
Doesn't everyone get drugs
relatively easily?

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.790 line:93%
The store sells them.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.580 line:93%
Even he took a lot of
cold medicine before.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.880 line:93%
Were they that dangerous?

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.590 line:93%
They must be different drugs.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.760 line:93%
The drugs they deal are much bigger.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.340 line:93%
They even distribute
Zolpidem, stimulants, and hallucinogens.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.680 line:93%
They'll force it on any deep pocket.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.350 line:93%
I know that jerk. The pimply jerk.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.110 line:93%
He bought drugs from me once.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.570 line:93%
Stop it.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.420 line:93%
HARU MILK

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.090 line:93%
Deep pocket straight ahead.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.550 line:93%
Isn't he the son of the Gangnam
barbecue restaurant owner?

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.060 line:93%
The rich boy.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.430 line:93%
Boss.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.400 line:93%
I found a boiler to keep us warm
this winter.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:46.700 line:93%
You'll do anything, right?

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:50.950 line:93%
Of course. Anything, if it'll cure me.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.210 line:93%
Okay, let's try it.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.270 line:93%
The psychologist Freud said

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.360 line:93%
the subconscious controls human behavior.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.280 line:93%
We'll find

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.700 line:93%
what the problem is,

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.540 line:93%
and what caused it,
from within your subconscious.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:38.210 line:93%
Doctor.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.210 line:93%
Okay.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.590 line:93%
Forget it.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:48.010 line:93%
Je-hyeok Kim, you will now enter the world

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.300 line:93%
of the subconscious,

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.680 line:93%
and will be hypnotized.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.520 line:93%
Focus all of your attention on this.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.950 line:93%
You are slowly

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.950 line:93%
crossing into the world of hypnosis.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:19.040 line:93%
Your eyelids are getting heavy,

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.710 line:93%
and you will fall asleep.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.340 line:93%
Red sun!

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.520 line:93%
Did it work?

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.900 line:93%
I'll check right now.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.030 line:93%
Here.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.500 line:93%
You will drink

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:02.250 line:93%
the most refreshing soda in this world.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.650 line:93%
It's so salty.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.480 line:93%
Salty!

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.400 line:93%
This isn't soda. It's soy sauce.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.150 line:93%
It's so salty.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.660 line:93%
It's so salty.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.120 line:93%
-So salty.
-Doctor.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.040 line:93%
May I have some soy sauce...

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.290 line:93%
It's so salty.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.380 line:93%
How did you know
we'd be needing soy sauce?

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.350 line:93%
Say hi, Je-hyeok. She's a psychotherapist.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:03.770 line:93%
Hello.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.690 line:93%
You'll draw a graph of your life.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.610 line:93%
The doctor says

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.700 line:93%
even if you are happy right now,

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.450 line:93%
it may always get bad,

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.540 line:93%
and even if you are miserable now,
it may always get better.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.620 line:93%
However, the most important thing
is the present.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.960 line:93%
Recognizing yourself
right at this very moment.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.260 line:93%
That is where healing begins.

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.720 line:93%
Okay. On this paper,

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.640 line:93%
draw a graph of your life
from childhood until now.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:46.900 line:93%
And mark exactly where you are right now.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:11.500 line:93%
Good.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.300 line:93%
Graph of your life

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.130 line:93%
Stop.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.560 line:93%
Je-hyeok, stop.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.060 line:93%
Doctor, we'll have to stop here for today.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.940 line:93%
Please come back tomorrow.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.980 line:93%
Stop, Je-hyeok. Stop!

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:16.740 line:93%
Hey.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.070 line:93%
I'm not done.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.370 line:93%
My current state is much lower than this.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.040 line:93%
I'm in jail.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.830 line:93%
I need to go much lower.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.960 line:93%
Let's go, you freak.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.290 line:93%
Let's go.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.420 line:93%
Let's go.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.090 line:93%
-Let's go.
-You said to do it, asshole.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.680 line:93%
Je-hyeok Kim Sets New Saves Record!

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.850 line:93%
Okay! The final step.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.560 line:93%
Remember the best moment of your life.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.100 line:93%
Even Major Leaguer John Smoltz

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.850 line:93%
suffered severe Steve Blass disease,

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.650 line:93%
but he was able to cure it by watching
the video of his World Series win

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.650 line:93%
over and over again.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.160 line:93%
Watch videos of your perfect pitches
repeatedly,

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.160 line:93%
and burn them

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.580 line:93%
into your brain.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.910 line:93%
Make that video

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.620 line:93%
replay itself in your head
whenever you throw a ball.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.840 line:93%
-Got it?
-Okay.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.550 line:93%
Okay. Here is a video
of the September 21, 2016 game.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.510 line:93%
It was the day you got your 48th save
and set the record

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.800 line:93%
for most saves in a season.

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.100 line:93%
Remember?

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:28.730 line:93%
Je-hyeok.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.270 line:93%
Je-hyeok, let's remember that day.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.190 line:93%
We're returning to that very day,
September 21, 2016.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:36.320 line:93%
Play ball!

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.320 line:93%
Don't.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.360 line:93%
What?

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.490 line:93%
I broke up with Ji-ho on this day.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:50.620 line:93%
I remember this day clearly.
September 21, 2016.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:55.290 line:93%
I'm sorry.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.710 line:93%
The day after her birthday.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:00.800 line:93%
I forgot her birthday.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:03.470 line:93%
I was self-absorbed.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.720 line:93%
Son of a bitch.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:10.230 line:93%
I had forgotten...

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:06.780 line:93%
JI-HO

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.920 line:93%
<i>Hi. What's up?</i>

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.790 line:93%
What else? Your boyfriend is about to die.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.920 line:93%
<i>What?</i>

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.380 line:93%
Let's meet for lunch tomorrow.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.340 line:93%
And why haven't you come to visit yet?

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:30.430 line:93%
Come quickly, or you'll end up
coming to his funeral.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.680 line:93%
Anyway, keep tomorrow lunch free.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:35.890 line:93%
Got it?

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.830 line:93%
Why is a college student interviewing you?

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000 line:93%
He said ten seconds ago
that it was for her senior thesis.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.630 line:93%
You're really slow at times.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.250 line:93%
Did you agree to do it?

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.090 line:93%
Of course, I did. She's coming tomorrow.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.640 line:93%
Je-hyeok, Jung-woo is ignoring me.
Yell at him.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.510 line:93%
Jung-woo, don't do that.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.850 line:93%
Joon-ho, may I go training...

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:26.490 line:93%
It's like he's got blinders on.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.110 line:93%
Je-hyeok isn't interested in anything
but baseball.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.750 line:93%
Captain Yoo. You have a letter
from your lawyer, Min-gu Kang.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.750 line:93%
Is he your retrial lawyer?

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.540 line:93%
Hang in there.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:45.590 line:93%
Thank you.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.720 line:93%
CHOCOLATE

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:49.800 line:93%
Eat it all by yourself.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.900 line:93%
Uncle, does that mean
you may get out before I do?

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.980 line:93%
I guess so.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.610 line:93%
If they decide soon,
I may get out before you.

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:12.030 line:93%
Once we get out,

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.910 line:93%
let's start a gathering.

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:16.870 line:93%
How about "I Love Jail"?

00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:20.870 line:93%
We can make a chatroom for our prison,

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:27.050 line:93%
and share memories of our time here,

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.840 line:93%
and things like that.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.560 line:93%
"Be careful of even falling leaves
before your release," goes the saying.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.230 line:93%
It's best to stay away from the scumbag
gangsters from Wing 6.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:46.360 line:93%
They aren't normal gangsters.
They're just obsessed with money.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.730 line:93%
I'm fine.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.190 line:93%
Han-yang, you.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.610 line:93%
You be careful. They may target you.

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:58.490 line:93%
Of course. Someone rich and in bad shape
like this person

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.580 line:93%
would totally be their VVIP client.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.670 line:93%
Jung-woo, is something wrong?

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.180 line:93%
Is there a problem with the retrial?

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.900 line:93%
My brother was fired from his university.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.110 line:93%
Goodness...

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.030 line:93%
I think he was dismissed.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:41.330 line:93%
<i>Your brother is doing well,
so don't worry.</i>

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.750 line:93%
<i>He's busy teaching
at the test prep academy.</i>

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.750 line:93%
<i>He says he feels much more at peace
than when he was a professor.</i>

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.710 line:93%
<i>I was shocked too when I heard
his university dismissed him,</i>

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.800 line:93%
<i>but through it all,
he worried a lot about you.</i>

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.400 line:93%
You bastard. How's your forehead?

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:08.900 line:93%
You bastard.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.150 line:93%
That bastard is always fighting.

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:16.990 line:93%
He won't grow up.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.580 line:93%
Why are you so nervous?
Are you going on a blind date?

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.120 line:93%
Right?

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.210 line:93%
Why am I so nervous about this?

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.170 line:93%
It's obvious what she'll ask.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.170 line:93%
What brought you here, how prison life is,

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.510 line:93%
what you want to do when you get out,
things like that.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:37.140 line:93%
Don't be nervous. Be yourself.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:39.300 line:93%
Okay.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:41.970 line:93%
Go on.

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.040 line:93%
You're handsome.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.710 line:93%
Pardon?

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:17.010 line:93%
You're more handsome than I expected.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:23.560 line:93%
I...

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:45.290 line:93%
My bad.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.880 line:93%
Where are you going?

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.250 line:93%
To see this bastard's master.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.180 line:93%
COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.940 line:93%
Are you taking the college
entrance exam again?

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.860 line:93%
What's with the practice tests?

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.400 line:93%
I started tutoring last week.
Two high school seniors.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.160 line:93%
I forgot everything.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.990 line:93%
I have to study first, or I'll be lost.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.080 line:93%
Why are you tutoring?
You must be busy with your studies.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.540 line:93%
I didn't get a scholarship this time.

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.500 line:93%
That's why I need to work like crazy.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.540 line:93%
Ask Je-hyeok to pay for you.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.340 line:93%
He'll pay his girlfriend's tuition.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.670 line:93%
Why? Are you insane?

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.260 line:93%
I can support myself.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.260 line:93%
Plus, I always got scholarships
in the past.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:45.220 line:93%
This is because of Je-hyeok!
Because of my ex-boyfriend.

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:47.720 line:93%
Ex-boyfriend?

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.270 line:93%
Aren't you back together?

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.520 line:93%
Why are you being this way?
You're scaring me.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.520 line:93%
Do you want to see Je-hyeok hang himself
in there?

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:58.610 line:93%
He's just counting the days
until you visit him.

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:01.740 line:93%
I said I'd go visit.
I never said I'd go out with him again.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:02.950 line:93%
Hey!

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.910 line:93%
Don't play games.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.450 line:93%
I wanted to see how you'd react.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.380 line:93%
I'll go out with him again,
and I'll go visit.

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.670 line:93%
Why are you messing with me?

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:20.590 line:93%
Stop laughing at me.

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:23.010 line:93%
I've been crazy busy with midterms,

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.300 line:93%
and I really had no time because of work.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.140 line:93%
Plus, I was trying to figure out
what to say

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.230 line:93%
when I see Je-hyeok again.
That's why I couldn't go.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:33.140 line:93%
"What to say"?

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.060 line:93%
I thought a lot about

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:39.150 line:93%
how to say what I need to say
without hurting my pride, but...

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.900 line:93%
I'll just do it my way.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.410 line:93%
I don't want to test the waters.
I won't do that.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.700 line:93%
I still like him a lot.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:55.620 line:93%
I like him so much.
Why should I play hard-to-get?

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.630 line:93%
I want to love him passionately.

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.730 line:93%
PETITION FOR RETRIAL

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:17.060 line:93%
What are you packing?

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:22.070 line:93%
Jung-woo's probably curious
about the petition for the retrial,

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.490 line:93%
so I'm mailing him a copy.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.450 line:93%
I already wrote him
and explained everything.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:27.450 line:93%
You did?

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:29.700 line:93%
Thanks.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:32.790 line:93%
When did you think of doing that?

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:35.500 line:93%
Lay off all this for a bit.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:39.090 line:93%
Focus on yourself until we get the result.

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:41.500 line:93%
Okay.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:50.300 line:93%
Did you tell him that I was fired?

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:55.560 line:93%
Didn't he know already?

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.650 line:93%
Also, here.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.570 line:93%
These are Je-hyeok's.
I brought them from home.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.240 line:93%
I'm sure he'll like having his own gloves.

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.700 line:93%
They look dirty, but these are the ones
he used last year when his team won.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.460 line:93%
Ji-ho, Je-hyeok...

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.380 line:93%
has Steve Blass.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:27.760 line:93%
He got Steve Blass.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.050 line:93%
He can't aim.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.850 line:93%
He can't throw strikes.

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:47.530 line:93%
I guess the interview went well.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:51.070 line:93%
I thought it would've been awkward
and frightening.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:53.450 line:93%
It wasn't awkward at all.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.410 line:93%
It wasn't awkward,
and I wasn't scared at all.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.420 line:93%
I'm talking about the college student.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.550 line:93%
That student didn't run away
when she saw you?

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:09.260 line:93%
You look really scary.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.680 line:93%
If there's anyone who isn't scared
when they first see you,

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.560 line:93%
they need to get their eyes checked.

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.560 line:93%
They must have really bad eyesight.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.110 line:93%
I'm in a very good mood today,

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.820 line:93%
so I won't hit you.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.650 line:93%
Thanks.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.530 line:93%
You said you wouldn't hit me.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.530 line:93%
You said you wouldn't hit me,
you wild hog!

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.710 line:93%
You punk. Come with me.
It's okay. It's okay.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:46.630 line:93%
I'll kill him and live here
for 40 more years.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.670 line:93%
Was I wrong? I didn't say anything wrong.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.430 line:93%
You're the size of a wild hog.

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:52.590 line:93%
If not, are you a rat?

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.180 line:93%
-Rat! Rat!
-Rat?

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.560 line:93%
I'm terrified of rats. Have you ever
stepped on a rat and killed it?

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.480 line:93%
-Get over here. Get over here.
-Wait.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.520 line:93%
-Get over here.
-Let go.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.440 line:93%
Let me hit you just once, no, three times.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.560 line:93%
-Get over here!
-I won't fall for it again!

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:08.150 line:93%
-Hit me. Hit me!
-Why you...

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:13.280 line:93%
That punk needs a beating.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.780 line:93%
-Hit me! Hit me!
-Let go! Shit!

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:16.530 line:93%
-I'll rip out your blood vessels.
-Let go.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:22.620 line:93%
Looney picks a fight with everyone.
Moving from one target to another.

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.790 line:93%
Like he's on a turf war.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.670 line:93%
-A mysterious fighter.
-Move.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:30.510 line:93%
No. He's just a psycho.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.970 line:93%
I do not feel pain.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:40.890 line:93%
We tried everything.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.270 line:93%
We started with Freudian psychoanalysis,
like hypnosis and therapy,

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.520 line:93%
I showed him videos,

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.570 line:93%
called in a famous psychiatrist

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.740 line:93%
and listened to research results
on the subconscious...

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.320 line:93%
I tried... I tried everything,

00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.950 line:93%
but nothing worked. Nothing.

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.080 line:93%
What do we do?

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.170 line:93%
Je-hyeok can't understand any of that.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.460 line:93%
What?

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:11.840 line:93%
What did you do to the most
simple-minded person in the world?

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.550 line:93%
Then what? What should I do?

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:22.890 line:93%
Here. You see this glove?
Put an "x" in the middle.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:32.690 line:93%
Tell him to throw here.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:35.490 line:93%
Don't say anything else.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:38.120 line:93%
Just tell him to throw at the "x."

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.080 line:93%
Just tell him that.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.120 line:93%
He can't understand anything else.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:16.860 line:93%
It worked.

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:20.070 line:93%
I caught it!

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.530 line:93%
Okay then. Enjoy yourself.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:09.830 line:93%
Wow. Ji-ho is your trainer.
She's your trainer.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.590 line:93%
Wow... How did she fix it in one try?

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.590 line:93%
Ji-ho is...

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.880 line:93%
like the wise Kongming to me.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:24.510 line:93%
You're right. She's like your Liang Zhuge.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:31.980 line:93%
It's Kongming, you idiot. Not Liang Zhuge.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.570 line:93%
Anyway, when is Ji-ho coming?

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.820 line:93%
Is she not coming?

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.320 line:93%
Call her. You can tell her
to hurry and come.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:45.280 line:93%
I'm too afraid to.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.120 line:93%
I'm afraid she'll say
she changed her mind.

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:53.670 line:93%
She says she still likes you.

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:57.090 line:93%
I mean it. That's what she told me.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.840 line:93%
She says she still likes you a lot.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.390 line:93%
She can't come
because she's busy with work,

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.640 line:93%
but she said she'll come next week.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.440 line:93%
She said you should train hard.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.820 line:93%
She said that if the Steve Blass is cured,

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.910 line:93%
she'll come right away.

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.830 line:93%
Dong-ho, let's go!

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:45.140 line:93%
It's so hot.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:50.930 line:93%
Retard.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.060 line:93%
SPICY CHIPS

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.370 line:93%
Excuse me, Mr. Han-yang Yoo.

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:08.490 line:93%
Jung-woo.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:10.490 line:93%
Hush.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.160 line:93%
It's not a good time to be prattling.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:18.500 line:93%
Don't get demerits for fighting,
and stay quiet for the time being.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:19.960 line:93%
Did something happen?

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:22.670 line:93%
The gangster bastards from Wing 6
caused trouble.

00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:25.010 line:93%
Captain Na.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.940 line:93%
<i>ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS</i>

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:55.040 line:93%
You should pack.

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.830 line:93%
You don't have much time left.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.460 line:93%
I may not get it.

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.590 line:93%
I feel like I'm getting my hopes up.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.800 line:93%
If it were Han-yang, maybe not,

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:13.390 line:93%
but you will definitely get out.

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:22.730 line:93%
Captain Yoo.

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:25.610 line:93%
Jung-woo.

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:28.780 line:93%
Want a drink?

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:38.620 line:93%
I'm cold.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.630 line:93%
Han-yang will end up in the hospital
at this rate.

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.090 line:93%
He's been getting worse.

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:51.390 line:93%
He's being released soon,

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.720 line:93%
so he has to hang in there
for a couple of weeks.

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.650 line:93%
You still didn't decide what to say
to your brother?

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.990 line:93%
Knowing that your brother quit
his job at the university

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:12.280 line:93%
must make you feel terrible.

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:14.120 line:93%
He didn't quit.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:18.830 line:93%
He was too busy with my retrial
and missed work for too long,

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:23.290 line:93%
and ended up getting dismissed.

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.220 line:93%
I want to tell him to stop
working on the retrial

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.970 line:93%
and to start looking for
another university.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.260 line:93%
He'll probably say to me
that he'll do just that,

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:40.140 line:93%
but continue working only on my retrial.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.690 line:93%
What should I do?

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:48.990 line:93%
From his perspective,
he wouldn't be able to relax

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.650 line:93%
until the retrial decision.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.910 line:93%
What should I say to him?

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:08.170 line:93%
What should I do?

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:11.800 line:93%
I'm sure Jung-woo

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.390 line:93%
will tell me to look for
another university.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.180 line:93%
Tell him you'll do that
once the retrial decision is out.

00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:19.770 line:93%
He won't believe me.

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:23.730 line:93%
He has a lot of pride and dignity.

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:29.070 line:93%
He probably thinks his brother
lost his job

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:32.360 line:93%
because of him,

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:35.990 line:93%
and is thinking of how to convince me

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:40.040 line:93%
to stop working on the retrial.

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:45.130 line:93%
He'll probably say he'll take care of
his own business and tell me to drop it.

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.630 line:93%
What should I do?

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.630 line:93%
We'll get the decision soon,

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:56.890 line:93%
and there's still so much to do.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.060 line:93%
SEOBU PENITENTIARY

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:43.980 line:93%
Gosh.

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.900 line:93%
It made the papers.

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.800 line:93%
Gosh.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.720 line:93%
It made the papers.

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.430 line:93%
Zolpidem?

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.690 line:93%

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:07.310 line:93%

00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:10.520 line:93%
What are you doing?
Get the head gangster in Wing 6.

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:12.740 line:93%
Interrogate him first!

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.950 line:93%
When does the head
ever do anything themselves?

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:19.910 line:93%
He'll just say he doesn't know.

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:25.080 line:93%
You should interrogate the druggies
that follow him first.

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:29.880 line:93%
It looked like those two
were dealing drugs.

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:33.130 line:93%
The reporters will be watching
how we handle this.

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:36.380 line:93%
We should investigate thoroughly

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:40.390 line:93%
and find everyone who bought
from them as well,

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:42.010 line:93%
and extend their sentences.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.350 line:93%
Who's in charge of Wing 6?

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:56.030 line:93%
Just once.

00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:58.280 line:93%
I sold it just once.

00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:00.160 line:93%
I'm not a repeat offender.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.280 line:93%
This is unfair.

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:03.950 line:93%
Drop the bull.

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:06.000 line:93%
Give me names.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.290 line:93%
Whom else did you sell to?

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:10.460 line:93%
These guys are really it.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.210 line:93%
And we know we're in deep shit.
Of course, we'll talk.

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:14.920 line:93%
Why would we not?

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.920 line:93%
So...

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.340 line:93%
-Is that all?
-Yes.

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:25.310 line:93%
What a shame. If you named
one or two more,

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:28.520 line:93%
I was going to cut back
on your sentence extension.

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:32.820 line:93%
No, right?

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:34.860 line:93%
There aren't any, is there?

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:39.070 line:93%
We're done.

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.280 line:93%
There is.

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.240 line:93%
There's one more.

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:45.540 line:93%
Give me some time.

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.500 line:93%
I'll name one more.

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:56.170 line:93%
Are you okay?

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.090 line:93%
He looks bad.

00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:01.970 line:93%
Han-yang, are you okay?

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.390 line:93%
Lieutenant Paeng!

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:10.940 line:93%
Lieutenant!

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.780 line:93%
I'm sure there aren't any more.

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.910 line:93%
There aren't many druggies here.

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:25.370 line:93%
Whether or not there are, we have to try.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:29.330 line:93%
If there is more, great. If not, oh, well.

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:30.960 line:93%
Let's go.

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.060 line:93%
Go ahead.

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:10.370 line:93%
VOLUNTEER

00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:11.960 line:93%
<i>Access granted.</i>

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.120 line:93%
SEGREGATION UNIT

00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:25.640 line:93%
I saw him.

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:29.060 line:93%
I saw him in the infirmary.

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.390 line:93%
We have no luck.
Why does he have to be in there now?

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.190 line:93%
Our young master

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:36.810 line:93%
needs his medicine.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.070 line:93%
-What should I do?
-What else?

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:45.110 line:93%
-We should go to the infirmary too.
-What?

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.410 line:93%
Hey.

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:47.870 line:93%
For breakfast tomorrow,

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:51.080 line:93%
give us laxatives.

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:55.170 line:93%
Let's have everyone in here
visit the infirmary.

00:56:58.090 --> 00:56:59.130 line:93%
And

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:02.340 line:93%
-you have that drug, right?
-Yes, of course.

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:05.260 line:93%
I'll bring it to the infirmary tomorrow.

00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:06.930 line:93%
You smart boy.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:09.310 line:93%
I'm relying on you.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.650 line:93%
Oh, my gosh.

00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:41.130 line:93%
I think they just need medicine.

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:44.880 line:93%
You feel better, right?

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:47.260 line:93%
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.680 line:93%
It's never-ending today. Come in.

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.230 line:93%
When should I take them?

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:02.320 line:93%
They say they keep throwing up,

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:04.690 line:93%
so they're going to sleep here today.

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.280 line:93%
We'll see how they feel in the morning,

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.990 line:93%
and then you can take them.

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:10.910 line:93%
What did they eat?

00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:12.700 line:93%
It's too cold for it to be food poisoning.

00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:14.790 line:93%
You can get food poisoning
in the winter too.

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.670 line:93%
I guess I'll be spending
the night here again.

00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:23.380 line:93%
Good luck.

00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:27.760 line:93%
Did Lieutenant Lee go somewhere?

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.550 line:93%
He went home earlier.

00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:33.260 line:93%
How did you get in then?

00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:36.100 line:93%
Joon-ho opened it for me.

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.060 line:93%
But he said he was late for his date,

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.690 line:93%
and handed me over
to a guard who was passing by.

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.650 line:93%
How will we go back?

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.150 line:93%
He said to hit that.

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.620 line:93%
He said if I hit that, a guard nearby
will come and take me.

00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:55.490 line:93%
He already told them.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.290 line:93%
He's a genius.

00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:03.420 line:93%
But it's kind of boring without Han-yang.

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:05.590 line:93%
I like it.

00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:08.170 line:93%
We should live among sane people.

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:11.640 line:93%
Han-yang may be better off
in the infirmary.

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:14.680 line:93%
What if the gangster punks go after him?

00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:17.270 line:93%
Oh.

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.690 line:93%
What?

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:23.980 line:93%
Those druggies should be
in the infirmary right now.

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.740 line:93%
Everyone in the hole
got food poisoning today.

00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:32.870 line:93%
The druggies were in bad shape
and will be staying there.

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:34.330 line:93%
It'll be okay, right?

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:36.160 line:93%
The medical officer is there,

00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:38.750 line:93%
and so are the guards. It should be fine.

00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:54.720 line:93%
Doctor!

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:56.470 line:93%
Doctor!

00:59:57.350 --> 00:59:58.180 line:93%
What is it?

00:59:58.270 --> 01:00:00.270 line:93%
I think he tore his ligament. Hurry!

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:02.440 line:93%
What? Where? Who?

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.480 line:93%
Cell 6A1.

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:05.610 line:93%
You should come too.

01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:07.650 line:93%
Sang-hui is really big,

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:09.610 line:93%
so you can't carry him on your own.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.530 line:93%
I knew that punk
would get himself in trouble.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.160 line:93%
-Let's go.
-Okay.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.330 line:93%
Shit.

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:46.810 line:93%
Thank you.

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:52.070 line:93%
-Captain Yoo. I need you.
-Me?

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:54.360 line:93%
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.120 line:93%
Hurry up and sit down. Sit.

01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:07.750 line:93%
-Thank you.
-Sure.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.550 line:93%
How is the retrial going?

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.880 line:93%
We submitted the petition.
They say it'll take time.

01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:22.520 line:93%
Ask me if you don't know something.

01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:24.690 line:93%
I majored in pre-law.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.560 line:93%
Okay.

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:28.940 line:93%
Actually, I've been studying
the law lately.

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:38.570 line:93%
That punk can smell food a mile away.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:39.950 line:93%
How did you know?

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:48.290 line:93%
We went to high school together.

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.340 line:93%
I got better grades, but he cheated

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:52.050 line:93%
and got into a medical undergrad.

01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:56.180 line:93%
Once I rat you out,
you're done for. Got that?

01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:57.380 line:93%
Got it.

01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:00.050 line:93%
Why are you here?
What about the infirmary?

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:01.970 line:93%
One of our guys is there.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:04.390 line:93%
They're all sleeping.

01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:06.690 line:93%
Lieutenant Ko went to take a nap too.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:11.060 line:93%
Hey. Did you order just one chicken?

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.400 line:93%
You punk.

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:17.450 line:93%
You need to become a bigger man.

01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:20.030 line:93%
Stop eating. There's nothing
for Captain Yoo.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.370 line:93%
I'm hungry.

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:24.290 line:93%
Captain Yoo, should I order you
some pork trotters?

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.770 line:93%
Okay, okay! Stop it already!

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.350 line:93%
It's so loud!

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.650 line:93%
Didn't you go home?

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:51.900 line:93%
I did.

01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:54.440 line:93%
I was having chicken and beer
with Chief Sim,

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:58.320 line:93%
and thought of... you know. Here.

01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:01.490 line:93%
Just happened to stumble upon it.

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:06.700 line:93%
There's no beer!

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:13.920 line:93%
Hey.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.890 line:93%
I should've bought one more.

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.560 line:93%
Yes. You should've bought three.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.690 line:93%
I'm on my third month
of receiving docked pay.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:42.820 line:93%
Anyway, where's Captain Yoo?
I need to feed Jung-woo too.

01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:44.660 line:93%
Officer Song called him away.

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.410 line:93%
Okay, then.

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:47.790 line:93%
He's having chicken.

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:51.120 line:93%
Song always has chicken at night.

01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:54.750 line:93%
What are you doing here?

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.840 line:93%
Someone said he tore his ligament,
so I went, but he was fine.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.760 line:93%
I was headed to the sleeping room
to take a nap,

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.340 line:93%
but I heard the gong.

01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:07.430 line:93%
I'm sure you smelled the chicken.
Don't lie so thoughtfully.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.600 line:93%
-Sit down and eat with us.
-Shall I?

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:13.440 line:93%
-Lieutenant Ko.
-Yeah?

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:15.520 line:93%
Shouldn't you be at the infirmary?

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:17.980 line:93%
Your wing's troublemakers are all there.

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:20.990 line:93%
It's okay. They should be sleeping.
They don't need me.

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:23.740 line:93%
Is the medic there?

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:26.120 line:93%
He went to meet a friend.

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:29.830 line:93%
Shit.

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:35.880 line:93%
You know what this is, right?

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.050 line:93%
-Stay still.
-Young master.

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:44.510 line:93%
-It's what you like.
-Open your mouth.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.600 line:93%
Open it, asshole. Open up.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.890 line:93%
Open up, asshole.

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:51.220 line:93%
Open up.

01:04:52.310 --> 01:04:53.560 line:93%
Here it comes.

01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:56.480 line:93%
Open up.

01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:57.650 line:93%
Freeze!

01:04:57.730 --> 01:04:58.900 line:93%
What are you doing?

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.360 line:93%
Take them away!

01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:03.450 line:93%
Get over here.

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:25.300 line:93%
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:27.720 line:93%
I'm not okay.

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:29.760 line:93%
Can't you tell?

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.270 line:93%
But what made you come

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:35.640 line:93%
at this timing?

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:41.190 line:93%
Are you telepathic?

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.610 line:93%
What are you doing here?

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:45.950 line:93%
I'm so out of breath.

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.160 line:93%
Why are you here?

01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:01.800 line:93%
<i>Why are you here?
What about the infirmary?</i>

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.710 line:93%
One of our guys is there.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.130 line:93%
They're all sleeping.

01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:08.550 line:93%
Lieutenant Ko went to take a nap too.

01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:12.810 line:93%
Hey. Did you order just one chicken?

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.020 line:93%
You punk.

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.100 line:93%
You need to become a bigger man.

01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:21.770 line:93%
Stop eating. There's nothing
for Captain Yoo.

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:22.980 line:93%
I'm hungry.

01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:25.320 line:93%
Captain Yoo, should I order you
some pork trotters?

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.870 line:93%
Officer Song, I have a favor to ask.

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:34.830 line:93%
Anything. I'll pick the stars
in the sky for you.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.750 line:93%
Please go to the infirmary with me.

01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:39.460 line:93%
Right now.

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:47.760 line:93%
Please take them too.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.760 line:93%
-Chief.
-Yes?

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.760 line:93%
Please help me.

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:04.730 line:93%
You're always fighting,
but I guess you still care.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.490 line:93%
I didn't do it because I like him.

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:10.110 line:93%
It's a crime, so I had no choice.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.620 line:93%
You little kid.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.380 line:93%
SEOBU PENITENTIARY

01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:47.730 line:93%
I heard.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.530 line:93%
Stop there. Don't say the next part.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:53.870 line:93%
I'll pretend you did.

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:15.350 line:93%
That student's coming today, isn't she?

01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:23.270 line:93%
He's so happy although she's a stranger.

01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:27.820 line:93%
Your brother's coming today, right?

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.090 line:93%
Min-chul! You have a visitor.

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.220 line:93%
Jung-woo, wait a little.

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:53.930 line:93%
You can go when Min-chul gets back.

01:08:55.050 --> 01:08:56.760 line:93%
Your brother's here.

01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.890 line:93%
Yes, sir.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.480 line:93%
Je-hyeok, you have a visitor.

01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:13.190 line:93%
It's the lawyer.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.330 line:93%
Sorry.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.840 line:93%
Let me ask you something.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.470 line:93%
You should've asked sooner.

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:23.640 line:93%
My brother will say he will,

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.890 line:93%
but he'll continue to work on
my retrial secretly.

01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:33.020 line:93%
But if I get angry and tell him
not to do it,

01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:35.900 line:93%
it'll hurt his feelings.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.490 line:93%
What should I do?

01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:43.370 line:93%
If it were you...

01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:48.120 line:93%
What would you do?

01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:52.210 line:93%
Do you know what your biggest problem is?

01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:57.760 line:93%
You're exhausting.

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.260 line:93%
You make everything way too complicated.

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:04.560 line:93%
You're only 30.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.810 line:93%
Why is everything so complicated
and difficult?

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.820 line:93%
You want your brother to be happy, right?

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.860 line:93%
But you need him too.

01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:24.450 line:93%
The retrial is just around the corner.

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:29.660 line:93%
Hey. If that falls through,
you'll end up like me.

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:36.170 line:93%
Your life is on the line, you bastard.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.720 line:93%
Just be honest with your brother.

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:47.810 line:93%
Ask him to stay with you until the end.

01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:49.560 line:93%
Tell him you need him.

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:56.900 line:93%
Tell him you're really,
really, really sorry,

01:11:57.570 --> 01:12:02.450 line:93%
but that you really need him.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.790 line:93%
Just be honest and say that.

01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:12.370 line:93%
I'm sure that's what your brother

01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:16.590 line:93%
wants to hear the most.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:40.280 line:93%
All you do is eat cookies,

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:44.280 line:93%
but you act like an adult

01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:47.080 line:93%
and think way too much.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.800 line:93%
Yes. Of course.

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:03.220 line:93%
Don't worry, Jung-woo.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.390 line:93%
I'll always stick right by your side.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.640 line:93%
Thanks.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.770 line:93%
For what? You're so weird.

01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:27.280 line:93%
Would you send me a book?

01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:29.740 line:93%
There are many I want to read.

01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:32.910 line:93%
The guards will give them to me
if you ask.

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:37.670 line:93%
Sure. Just tell me what to get.
I'll buy them all for you.

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:40.000 line:93%
Do you need anything else?

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:42.210 line:93%
How much is left
in your commissary account?

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.130 line:93%
What about thermals?
Are you wearing thermals?

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.760 line:93%
Is any cellmate bothering you?

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.390 line:93%
Who else has been released?

01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:52.180 line:93%
Ask one at a time.

01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:55.140 line:93%
Okay. Sure.

01:13:57.150 --> 01:13:58.270 line:93%
Sure.

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:12.240 line:93%
Are you that happy?

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.540 line:93%
Yes.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.250 line:93%
Whenever I talk to her,

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.080 line:93%
I feel...

01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:22.500 line:93%
I feel good.

01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:29.140 line:93%
I was lucky.

01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:33.560 line:93%
I was lucky that I was paired up with her.

01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:38.390 line:93%
I wouldn't have been able to talk
as comfortably with someone else.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.560 line:93%
What do you mean?

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.150 line:93%
She chose you.

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:48.660 line:93%
She said from the start that she wanted
to interview Min-chul Kim.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.290 line:93%
Do you know her?

01:14:56.370 --> 01:14:58.160 line:93%
I don't know anyone.

01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:00.330 line:93%
Maybe she's family?

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.500 line:93%
Whatever.

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:13.390 line:93%
Je-hyeok, is your Steve Blass cured now?

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.310 line:93%
Your suffering is over now.
What else could happen?

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.100 line:93%
Crony has gotten so nice, too.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.770 line:93%
Right?

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:26.320 line:93%
You'll be getting out soon.
You're almost there.

01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:31.990 line:93%
Okay, okay! Attention!

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:37.080 line:93%
Ten inmates from Daegu Penitentiary

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.580 line:93%
are here to tour our greenhouse.

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.420 line:93%
Why?

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.880 line:93%
Our greenhouse is the best in the nation.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.710 line:93%
They come once in a while
to learn from us.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.340 line:93%
They'll be staying here for two months,

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:51.680 line:93%
and learn the know-hows of our greenhouse.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.180 line:93%
Here they are. Come in.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.690 line:93%
What the hell?

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:37.930 line:93%
Okay, you're all grown-ups. Speak nicely.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:40.640 line:93%
I hope you'll get along
for the next two months.

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:42.310 line:93%
Everyone, bow.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.230 line:93%
A greenhouse training room?
