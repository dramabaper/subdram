What are you going to do now that you've tasted Sam Jang's blood?

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.720 line:93%
The fresh blood, flesh, and bones of Sam Jang are walking in.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.780 line:93%
It's driving you crazy, right?

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.550 line:93%
I'm someone who has been practicing asceticism for 1,000 years and will one day be a deity.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.930 line:93%
This tee-ny amount of blood

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.740 line:93%
isn't enough to bring me down.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.700 line:93%
Agh! What the heck! It's no fun if you're unaffected.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.430 line:93%
Ugh, it took a lot for me to prepare for this!

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.550 line:93%
Underhanded punk... How long have you been preparing for this?

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.090 line:93%
"Her pain is your pain."

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.620 line:93%
I made up my mind thanks to the determination you gave me.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.980 line:93%
Ugh, it hurts. You suffer too.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.780 line:93%
Suffer the mightiest of pains!

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.660 line:93%
I'm definitely going to make you hurt like that.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.420 line:93%
But what are you going to do about this? I'm not hurting one bit.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.380 line:93%
I am extremely pleased to have disappointed you.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.090 line:93%
No, no, no. I'm not a careless monkey who gets so easily discouraged.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.750 line:93%
Now then, get excited. Starting now, it's an endurance test.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.890 line:93%
What trick are you pulling out of your sleeve now?

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.340 line:93%
Try being alone with Sam Jang.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.210 line:93%
What?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.480 line:93%
Endure it until this has run out. I'll vacate the room for you.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.400 line:93%
Good luck.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.050 line:93%
Ma Wang.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.400 line:93%
- Sam Jang.
- The door was open so I just let myself in.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.390 line:93%
I came because I heard a congratulatory party was being held for you today.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.650 line:93%
It looks like I'm the first one here.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.040 line:93%
I heard you received a big award. Congratulations!

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.920 line:93%
Th-Thank you. Come have a seat.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.620 line:93%
I see you've lit a lot of candles. They smell nice.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.070 line:93%
What fragrance is this?

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.700 line:93%
Lotus flower.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.480 line:93%
So this is what lotus flower smells like.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.090 line:93%
I was told because I'm Sam Jang, my blood has a lotus flower scent.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.290 line:93%
Is this what it smells like then?

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.850 line:93%
Can I help you with something?

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.230 line:93%
D-Don't come near me!

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.250 line:93%
Are you all right?

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.680 line:93%
Son Oh Gong!

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.820 line:93%
What did you drag me out of there all of a sudden for?

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.540 line:93%
Ma Wang is feeling a little sick. His pain is my fun.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.710 line:93%
When he's in pain, I sit back and laugh.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.980 line:93%
Are you playing some sort of prank right now? In this cold?

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.920 line:93%
- You're cold?
- Of course I'm cold!

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.560 line:93%
Well, the weather is cold. Seeing how it's this chilly when we're indoors.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.250 line:93%
If you're wearing that coat and are cold, then how do you think I feel?

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.020 line:93%
I don't want to know. If I know that you're feeling excruciatingly cold,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.490 line:93%
I love you so much that I'd want to take this coat off and give it to you.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.890 line:93%
I don't want to take it off.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.720 line:93%
Don't look at me like that.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.140 line:93%
Son Oh Gong, I'm cold.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.350 line:93%
Ah, so cold.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.560 line:93%
For now, let's go to Sureumdong.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.160 line:93%
Sureumdong? Is that some sort of sauna?

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.570 line:93%
I should be able to make a path to Sureumdong somewhere around here...

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.330 line:93%
Follow me.

<i>[Difficult college entrance exams.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.400 line:93%
Here it is.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.690 line:93%
Our Oh Jeong made a lot of paths for me to Sureumdong.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.510 line:93%
This is the path to Sureumdong.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.030 line:93%
But this is an advertisement for a college entrance exam?

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.500 line:93%
It's written right here on this sign. Sureumdong.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.070 line:93%
Oh? It really is. Sureumdong.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.650 line:93%
Here I'm...

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.770 line:93%
Let's go.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.250 line:93%
Wow, this is Sureumdong?

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.470 line:93%
So it's not a sauna but a bar.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.190 line:93%
It's not a bar; it's my home.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.860 line:93%
Sit down.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.990 line:93%
Having a drink will warm you up.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.090 line:93%
What should you drink?

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.980 line:93%
I want this one.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.900 line:93%
This one?

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.900 line:93%
You know how to pick the best...

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.190 line:93%
It smells good.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.600 line:93%
Delicious.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.110 line:93%
This is really hard to come by though...

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.000 line:93%
Didn't you say you couldn't drink?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.340 line:93%
Having all these collected here is wasted on you so I'll drink them for you.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.260 line:93%
I'm going to drink them! As soon as that drinking ban is rescinded, I'm going to drink them all.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.890 line:93%
Ah, the drinking ban.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.160 line:93%
You said you were being punished, right?

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.990 line:93%
Great Sage, what crime did you commit that you needed to be punished for?

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.910 line:93%
That's heavenly realm business. A mere human doesn't need to know.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.330 line:93%
I guess it must be a really bad crime.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.050 line:93%
You said so before, didn't you?

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.750 line:93%
That you were an extremely bad guy, and so you were being locked up.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.380 line:93%
- What was that place called again?
- The Five Elements Mountain.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.790 line:93%
Right. The Five Elements Mountain. How long were you locked up in there?

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.630 line:93%
Don't know. I gave up counting after 500 years.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.720 line:93%
- You were there by yourself for over 500 years?
- Yeah.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.380 line:93%
Since I was still fine even after being sealed and roasted in the Eight Trigram furnace for 49 days,

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.840 line:93%
they locked me up on the Five Elements Mountain.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.010 line:93%
It must have been really hard.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:56.070 line:93%
Being alone for that long, wasn't it lonely?

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.910 line:93%
That's a really horrific punishment.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.790 line:93%
Later on, when your drinking ban is lifted, I'll buy you alcohol that's even better than this.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.180 line:93%
Will there be any reason for me to see you once the drinking ban is lifted?

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:18.720 line:93%
Human Jin Seon Mi, I doubt you have the right to be forcing your sympathy on me right now.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.660 line:93%
Think about it. You're the one that's locking me up now.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:32.170 line:93%
- You're right.
- Sam Jang, right now, you're another Five Elements Mountain to me.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:40.030 line:93%
You must want to free yourself just like back then at the Five Elements Mountain.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.560 line:93%
Yeah. I'd like it if you disappeared.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.400 line:93%
Right. For now, I'll disappear from here.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.230 line:93%
How do I get out of here?

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.890 line:93%
You can get out by going out the same way you came in.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.950 line:93%
I'll go.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.680 line:93%
It's cold outside of Sureumdong. Wear that and go.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.670 line:93%
No need.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.690 line:93%
I'd rather just disappear.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:39.800 line:93%
I can't let you. It's more painful than being roasted in the Eight Trigram Furnace for 49 days

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.910 line:93%
for me to see you cold.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.120 line:93%
Take this with you too. You said it was good.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:00.320 line:93%
No. If you're good to me, I can't feel at ease.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.830 line:93%
Don't feel at ease. If I have to be tormented, then you should at least be uncomfortable.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.800 line:93%
My love for you makes me keep you safe,

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.160 line:93%
but I don't want to make you happy.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.560 line:93%
You're a Five Elements Mountain after all.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.950 line:93%
All right. I'll uncomfortably take it with me and unhappily drink it.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.130 line:93%
I'd be thankful for that.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.400 line:93%
Sam Jang disappeared?

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.630 line:93%
Yes. She left her coat and purse here and just disappeared.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.250 line:93%
And you said Ma Wang and Oh Gong weren't here either.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.460 line:93%
I think they were drinking together,

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.660 line:93%
but when I got here they were both gone.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:06.930 line:93%
This sensitive pig nose is getting a whiff of something suspicious.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.290 line:93%
It feels like something definitely happened.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.530 line:93%
A real trouble has come up.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.370 line:93%
Right? You think something happened too, don't you, Sa Oh Jeong?

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.010 line:93%
This is a cup that Hyungnim uses often,

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.260 line:93%
but it's got a stain.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.150 line:93%
What could this stain be from?

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.790 line:93%
Coffee? Black tea?

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.610 line:93%
How am I supposed to know that? Just throw it away!

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.980 line:93%
I'll have to try cleaning it with baking soda.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.590 line:93%
Honestly, when he's got enough money to start a ceramics factory and still have money leftover,

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.570 line:93%
what's he got to be so dirty for?

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.100 line:93%
Ma Wang's ring is empty.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.330 line:93%
<i>Ma Wang, the thing you put in here is Sam Jang's blood, right? Can't you give this ring to me?</i>

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.210 line:93%
<i>Do not covet</i>

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.250 line:93%
<i>that which isn't yours.</i>

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.760 line:93%
Where oh where could the blood that was in this have gone?

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.640 line:93%
Looks like some real fun has started.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.990 line:93%
Ma Wang, have you recovered your strength?

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.320 line:93%
Should I get you more energy stones?

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.520 line:93%
I'm fine.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.750 line:93%
My voice!

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.480 line:93%
Ma Wang, your voice is...

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.960 line:93%
Se-se-se...

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.520 line:93%
I...

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.860 line:93%
I'm fine.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:06.580 line:93%
Hurry up and get me some medicine that will...

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.080 line:93%
That will...

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:16.310 line:93%
That will wipe out the blood's potency.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.140 line:93%
Yes, sir.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.870 line:93%
I'm fine. I'm unaffected.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.080 line:93%
Completely un...

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.980 line:93%
unaffected.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.060 line:93%
- What brings you here without notice?
- There's something I urgently need.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.860 line:93%
Grandmother's not here though.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.300 line:93%
That's a problem.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.320 line:93%
When is she coming back?

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.650 line:93%
Don't know. She said she'd be gone a long while this time.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.530 line:93%
This is important, so answer properly.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.390 line:93%
If you're going to act like this then I might just close up shop and run away from home.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.820 line:93%
Then you won't be able to get anything.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:38.820 line:93%
Please? Get the item for me.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.450 line:93%
Okay. But in return, pay in cash.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.490 line:93%
No receipt so Grandmother doesn't know.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.160 line:93%
Come on in.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.950 line:93%
Is Ma Wang sick?

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.550 line:93%
A demon that consumed Sam Jang's blood

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.090 line:93%
would have quite a huge craving for her.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.560 line:93%
It must have been extremely painful for Ma Wang to try to resist that.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.170 line:93%
Yeah.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:41.610 line:93%
He was going on about mental perseverance for 1,000 years but couldn't even handle this little amount of time.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.620 line:93%
I believed in his abilities and so prepared a big hourglass, you know.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.140 line:93%
He almost got our Sam Jang.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.740 line:93%
If you hadn't gone in,

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.210 line:93%
then Sam Jang would already be gone by Ma Wang's hands.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.530 line:93%
She probably would.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:58.410 line:93%
It's a pity but because of this thing, I've got no choice but to protect her for now.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:03.920 line:93%
Great Sage, shall I buy you some time?

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.600 line:93%
Although I don't have the ability to stop it for as long as you can,

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.360 line:93%
it's possible for me to hold back this much time.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.680 line:93%
If I keep a hold on just this much time,

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.170 line:93%
then you'll be able to use Ma Wang to get rid of Sam Jang.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:20.220 line:93%
It's a chance to free yourself from Sam Jang's control.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.600 line:93%
I can get rid of her?

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.490 line:93%
For now, get a strawberry ice cream ready for take out before the hourglass runs out.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.000 line:93%
Yes, sir.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.070 line:93%
Will you be able to do the broadcast taping today?

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.360 line:93%
Should I cancel your scheduled activities?

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.890 line:93%
Because the medicine you g-g-got me...

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.120 line:93%
calmed me down a bit.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.140 line:93%
It's a relief.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.570 line:93%
But it looks like you're still suffering from side effects.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:14.070 line:93%
I think I have to take someth...

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:19.260 line:93%
something that's m-more eff-effective.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.290 line:93%
You've already lost a lot of your vigor from taking the medicine.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.180 line:93%
Taking something stronger would be irrational.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.120 line:93%
I'm fine.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:32.000 line:93%
Rather than this embarrass-ssment from not being able to su-suppress my craving

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.060 line:93%
and drooooling like this,

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:40.430 line:93%
taking medicine and losing some energy is...

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.830 line:93%
Seeing as you've already become like this, what do you think about just eating Sam Jang?

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.970 line:93%
Don't talk about Sam Jang!

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.370 line:93%
Just what is Sam Jang? Why do you have to suffer because of Sam Jang?

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.020 line:93%
I'll capture Sam Jang. Please eat Sam Jang.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.350 line:93%
I told you not to talk about Sam Jang.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:02.250 line:93%
Even just hearing the sound of Sam Jang makes me shake more!

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.070 line:93%
- Darn it!
- I apologize.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.410 line:93%
I got slightly fooled while being careless,

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:13.350 line:93%
but I won't b-b-break down anymore!

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.870 line:93%
That's fine.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.270 line:93%
All my scheduled events

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:33.980 line:93%
will proceed as p-p-planned.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.350 line:93%
Understood.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.250 line:93%
So tired...

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:48.130 line:93%
CEO, do you want to go see the flower shop that's up for sale in Paju?

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.910 line:93%
Sorry, I have to go to the broadcasting station for a bit.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.100 line:93%
The broadcasting station?

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.640 line:93%
You're finally making your television debut?

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.210 line:93%
What's it for? Shopping channel? Variety program? What?

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:06.570 line:93%
It's not for that kind of thing. I just need to see PK real quick.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.820 line:93%
"See PK real quick?" You've become that kind of person?

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.390 line:93%
Wow, this is just...

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.810 line:93%
"I'm going to play a round of baseball with (Jang) Dong Geun and have a beer with (Jo) In Sung."

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.470 line:93%
"I'm going shopping with Tae Yang." It's just like that kind of thing!

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:23.060 line:93%
CEO, you're really awesome.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.990 line:93%
If you knew the truth, I wouldn't be as great as you think I am.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.090 line:93%
But then again, I hear that these days

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.900 line:93%
celebrities have their own share of life issues.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.470 line:93%
That could be possible.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:42.360 line:93%
CEO, next time, can you ask PK to take a picture with my daughter?

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.410 line:93%
Sure. I'll talk to him about it.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:47.400 line:93%
Salute! Salute! Oh, wait a minute.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.950 line:93%
I mean, what kind of celebrity drives themselves?

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.900 line:93%
Call that bodyguard or Secretary Son guy over.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.610 line:93%
I don't want to bother him. He already feels burdened.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.570 line:93%
I'll be back.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.580 line:93%
This is why you have to pick people well.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.890 line:93%
There's no other person like me.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.450 line:93%
They only cared about looks and picked a total swallow <i>(homonym for gigolo)</i>

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.740 line:93%
and can't even use him properly. Ouch!

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.920 line:93%
Who was that?

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:25.870 line:93%
That cocky realtor. No wonder my ears were itching.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:30.230 line:93%
How dare he call me a swallow? I'm a monkey.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.720 line:93%
Now.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.320 line:93%
I'm glad the medicine I found was effective.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.260 line:93%
I got a lot of my energy back through the energy from the audience.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.610 line:93%
As expected, the energy from the live broadcasts is the best.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.480 line:93%
Excuse me! Chairman Woo Hwi, could you give us your autograph?

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.760 line:93%
Oh, sure. Of course.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.450 line:93%
- Your name?
- Hye Soo.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.660 line:93%
Hye Soo. What a pretty name.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.620 line:93%
Heart. There.
<i>[You're my destiny, Chairman Woo Hwi]</i>

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.450 line:93%
"You're my destiny?" Why, thank you.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.280 line:93%
Can you take a picture of us all?

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.520 line:93%
Of course. I was waiting for that. Come on over here.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.140 line:93%
Now then...

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.740 line:93%
Yes, Jeo Pal Gye. I'm at the broadcasting station.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.770 line:93%
Where should I go?

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:24.070 line:93%
The second floor? Okay.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.270 line:93%
- It came out well.
- Take one with mine too, please.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:30.850 line:93%
Of course. Come here. Now then,

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.770 line:93%
One, two, thr...

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.070 line:93%
Ah, I apologize. I'm sorry.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:45.200 line:93%
Come here. Now, one, two, three.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.290 line:93%
Thank you!

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.060 line:93%
Are you all right?

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.150 line:93%
You're doing badly again?

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:02.230 line:93%
That photo just now caught my eyes changing. Follow them and delete it.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.050 line:93%
Understood.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:09.060 line:93%
Why is this acting up like this?

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.180 line:93%
What's wrong with these? Calm down!

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.740 line:93%
It's not even like Sam Jang is next to me. Right?

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.790 line:93%
No, why is Sam Jang here?

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.610 line:93%
Ma Wang!

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.700 line:93%
Chairman! Chairman!

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.590 line:93%
You did amazing at today's filming!

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.370 line:93%
You know that our viewership went up again?

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:25.640 line:93%
- Our viewership is all thanks to you, Chairman!
- Thank you! Thank...

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.220 line:93%
Oh, is the Chairman sick somewhere?

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.570 line:93%
- Oh, why is he like that?
- Does he have hand tremors?

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:33.300 line:93%
Maybe he worked too hard for the shoot?

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:29.930 line:93%
♪ <i>I remember those cold days</i> ♪

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:36.640 line:93%
♪ <i>Afraid that my trembling heart will cry alone</i> ♪

♪ <i>When I open my eyes, it fades away</i> ♪

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:56.450 line:93%
Here. There you go.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.490 line:93%
The things you left behind at Ma Wang's house.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.740 line:93%
Thank you for bringing them to me.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:04.410 line:93%
Oh, is Ma Wang at the studio today, too?

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.750 line:93%
I'm not sure.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.470 line:93%
Sam Jang, be careful.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:10.990 line:93%
Pardon?

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.930 line:93%
Oh, never mind.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.560 line:93%
Just saying not to leave your things behind like that.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.140 line:93%
Bye.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.080 line:93%
Are you looking for Ma Wang?

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:41.730 line:93%
- Where is he?
- Ma Wang ended up wanting to eat up Sam Jang, right?

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:46.470 line:93%
Pig, if you open your mouth, I'll bite you to shreds.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.290 line:93%
Calm down. Calm down.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:53.770 line:93%
I'm also for Ma Wang eating up Sam Jang, too.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:56.130 line:93%
If there's anything I can help with, I will.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:00.530 line:93%
But in return, I'm reserving a bite for me.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.610 line:93%
- Let's see.
- Hey, don't touch.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.700 line:93%
It must be hard for you to endure.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.800 line:93%
Who do you think caused all this?

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.910 line:93%
How dare you try to comfort me just because you have a mouth? Keep it to yourself.

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:32.240 line:93%
Fine. Then I'll keep the comforting words inside.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.940 line:93%
- Should I apologize instead?
- No. Just chew and swallow it.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.860 line:93%
I don't even want to hear your voice.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:44.610 line:93%
Fine. At times like these, being near you and saying all this probably sounds like I'm just trying to make fun.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.650 line:93%
Because of that Geumganggo, I was also having a hard time.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:50.250 line:93%
"Feel what she feels." "Love."

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.010 line:93%
♪ "Because I love you."

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:55.320 line:93%
When you did those things, I was so upset.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.270 line:93%
I couldn't keep myself from doing this to you. You understand my situation, right?

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:01.200 line:93%
Yeah, I understand it very well.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.910 line:93%
I will also make sure to get my revenge for this, okay?

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.270 line:93%
I hope you do.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:15.060 line:93%
You tell me you had the patience of a thousand years, yet you couldn't endure this long.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:20.370 line:93%
If I don't endure, the person you love will disappear.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.100 line:93%
You will die from torment.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.250 line:93%
Ma Wang, that's not it.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.780 line:93%
If Sam Jang dies and disappears, so will the Geumganggo.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.010 line:93%
So whether she dies then or not, I won't be tormented.

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:34.270 line:93%
Whatever the case, right now, because of this Guemganggo,

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.970 line:93%
you can't let Sam Jang die.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:44.460 line:93%
Aigoo, he hit hard on purpose... That Dang Soo...

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.590 line:93%
<i>If I keep a hold on just this much time,</i>

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:50.210 line:93%
<i>then you'll be able to use Ma Wang to get rid of Sam Jang.</i>

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:53.020 line:93%
<i>It's a chance to free yourself from Sam Jang's control.</i>

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.070 line:93%
- Why do you keep shaking?
- It's the side effect of the medicine for deadening the blood's energy.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.730 line:93%
Oh, give it to me. I'll pour it for you.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.890 line:93%
Seriously. Side effects...

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.890 line:93%
Thank you.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:31.470 line:93%
Aigoo. It's because of the side effects.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.200 line:93%
Oh, so refreshing.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:59.130 line:93%
If I find the car, will I figure out who I am?

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.100 line:93%
Hey, what are you doing?

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:12.950 line:93%
Oh? You're that trainee from before.

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:16.710 line:93%
I nearly died from having nightmares because of you.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:18.200 line:93%
So unlucky.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.760 line:93%
I don't want to see you, so go away.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.280 line:93%
Huh? What's this?

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:28.540 line:93%
- Hey, did you just scratch my car?
- It wasn't me.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.310 line:93%
I didn't even touch it.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:33.480 line:93%
Where are you going?!

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.850 line:93%
I've caught you red-handed.

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:42.240 line:93%
The thing you just dropped, you used it to scratch my car, right?

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.960 line:93%
What is this?

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:56.800 line:93%
Give it to me. It's my eye.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.600 line:93%
That... goes in... there.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.910 line:93%
Alice!

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:23.050 line:93%
When did she get that drunk?

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:26.120 line:93%
Anyway, thank you for taking care of her.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.930 line:93%
You're pretty.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:31.150 line:93%
Are you hoping to be an entertainer by chance?

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.680 line:93%
Maybe.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.030 line:93%
You know the audition programs that are popular these days, right?

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.180 line:93%
I'm a casting manager for them.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.480 line:93%
If you're interested in auditioning, give me a call.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.950 line:93%
It's a chance for you to get famous.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.970 line:93%
Is the flower shop that's up for sale?

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:01.200 line:93%
Yes. She wants to sell fast and just wants what the land is worth.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.510 line:93%
The owner has gone half insane after her boyfriend died.

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:10.920 line:93%
<i>Aigoo, this is worth a good amount.</i>

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.280 line:93%
<i>If you give me a little time, I could get you the full price.</i>

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.420 line:93%
<i>Please take care of it as soon as possible.</i>

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:20.700 line:93%
I saw her during the consultation, but she was withering away like a dying flower.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.040 line:93%
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.430 line:93%
Hello.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.650 line:93%
You seem very different.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.810 line:93%
I feel different, too.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.660 line:93%
I don't want to sell the shop anymore. Sorry.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.360 line:93%
Pardon?

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.420 line:93%
You said you wanted to sell straight away.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.700 line:93%
While crying, you said you had too many memories here and you couldn't stay any longer. If you do this now...

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.290 line:93%
I felt like that then, but I have no feelings like that anymore.

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:59.020 line:93%
I see that you cut your hair, too.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:02.230 line:93%
Yes. I'm sorry about this.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:05.830 line:93%
Pick something. I'll give it to you.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.460 line:93%
Omo.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.440 line:93%
Amazing.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.950 line:93%
They say that when women cut their hair, it sorts out their feelings, too.

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:20.040 line:93%
It must really be true. Wow, it's amazing.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.840 line:93%
It looks like something cut it off.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.990 line:93%
I wonder who cut it.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.860 line:93%
Probably the hair salon cut it.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.660 line:93%
Do you like that style?

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.300 line:93%
You want me to ask her which salon cut it?

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.320 line:93%
I think I know.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.690 line:93%
Was it you? Did you cut it?

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:51.390 line:93%
Right. It's possible to have a conversation with a tree.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.290 line:93%
It doesn't matter.

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.930 line:93%
I won't ask and won't be curious.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.010 line:93%
I'll just go pick out the most expensive plant.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:06.690 line:93%
There's an evil spirit left on the hair.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:10.270 line:93%
Did you cut your girlfriend's hair?

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:25.290 line:93%
Then was that woman affected by an evil spirit?

00:38:34.314 --> 00:38:39.314 line:93%
<font color="#80ffff">[Viki Ver] E06 A Korean Odyssey (Hwayugi)</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.780 line:93%
It cut her hair here?

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.540 line:93%
Maybe it's not a dangerous demon?

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.010 line:93%
Miss.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:07.220 line:93%
Please buy one.

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.610 line:93%
I don't have a boyfriend to use this with.

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.790 line:93%
Please buy it from me.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:18.800 line:93%
Grandma, have you heard of someone at this park getting her hair cut?

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.980 line:93%
Give me one.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.070 line:93%
5,000 won.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.260 line:93%
Hyungnim.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.160 line:93%
Oh. Sit down.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:58.100 line:93%
I'll help you all I can to get rid of Sam Jang.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.710 line:93%
I'd be thankful.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.120 line:93%
But you don't need to close your business because of me.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.340 line:93%
Finish your business for the rest of the day, and then let's think about it slowly.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:12.810 line:93%
It's okay. Once Ma Wang is done with the detoxification, we will no longer have a chance.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.590 line:93%
That's true. We'll have to hurry.

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:20.740 line:93%
If we make a plan and decide on the path, we can get rid of Sam Jang tonight.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.340 line:93%
Right away tonight?

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.440 line:93%
A cold wave is coming tonight.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.010 line:93%
The chance for success will be higher if I use the power of the Winter General properly.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:37.460 line:93%
I'll hold onto you so that you can't run to her until Ma Wang eats up Sam Jang.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.520 line:93%
Tonight.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.870 line:93%
We don't have much time left.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:49.540 line:93%
Oh! Today! Today's Oh Jeong's yakbap <i>(flavored rice)</i> day!

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.710 line:93%
Oh Jeong said he would make some yakbab and wait tonight.

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.030 line:93%
Since it's a dish that takes a lot of effort to make,

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:58.150 line:93%
he'll be really disappointed if I don't eat it while it's warm.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.880 line:93%
Yakbap is good even if you eat it after it cools down.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.390 line:93%
Really? I see.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:11.000 line:93%
I also have to watch <i>My Golden Life.</i> Do you not watch it?

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.900 line:93%
There's a repeat airing tomorrow morning.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:17.840 line:93%
Watch it freely in a world without Sam Jang.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.810 line:93%
I have to watch it live, though.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:22.860 line:93%
<i>Son Oh Gong!</i>

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.110 line:93%
Oh! Sam Jang is calling me.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:31.040 line:93%
Ah, seriously. It's all ruined. I don't think tonight's possible.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.100 line:93%
Why don't you go and finish your business for the rest of the day, too?

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.560 line:93%
You have to earn to live well.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.980 line:93%
I'll be going.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.680 line:93%
Hyungnim!

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:45.140 line:93%
Tonight with the cold wave would be perfect.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:51.340 line:93%
Why did you call me from somewhere so cold instead of somewhere warm?

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:55.240 line:93%
In this park, there were a few people who had their hair shorn.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:01.780 line:93%
But I can't tell whether it's the work of an evil spirit or not, so I called you.

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.650 line:93%
Sorry for calling you to somewhere cold.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:08.030 line:93%
Not me but you. You're cold. Your cheeks are red.

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.810 line:93%
There's a cold wave coming tonight.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:11.680 line:93%
I know.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.990 line:93%
<i>The cold wave is coming. I don't want to send her off on a chilly night.</i>

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.740 line:93%
- What is it?
- You wore something even prettier today.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:25.660 line:93%
This? I've worn this often.

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:28.510 line:93%
Do you want me to buy you some clothes? You like green.

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:31.850 line:93%
I think I should get you a green coat on the way home.

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:35.040 line:93%
How about something to eat? Should we go to a family restaurant? Like a family?

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.280 line:93%
Did something happen?

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.710 line:93%
You're being so different from what you said yesterday.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:43.790 line:93%
- What did I say?
- You said you wanted me to disappear.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:48.520 line:93%
I just want to treat you well, that's all.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.320 line:93%
You're not complaining that you have to be nice because of the Geumganggo.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.730 line:93%
You must mean it.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:56.710 line:93%
What are you talking about? I've been consistently nice to you.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:59.490 line:93%
It's the first time you said you'd be nice and mean it.

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:05.290 line:93%
Oh no, there was once before when you were being sincerely nice.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:09.990 line:93%
When you were trying to convince me to give up this lifetime, you were nice to me.

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:13.800 line:93%
You were being nice saying you wished me to never have any regrets when I died.

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:20.090 line:93%
Oh, there's a lot of people lined up.

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.810 line:93%
It must be something tasty. Let's go.

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:28.960 line:93%
Come on, let's go see.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.040 line:93%
What is that? It's a ball of cotton.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.590 line:93%
Why would they line up for this?

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.180 line:93%
You don't know cotton candy?

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.050 line:93%
You like ice-cream. This is really sweet, too.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.750 line:93%
Sweet? You want to have some?

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.590 line:93%
Okay.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:49.670 line:93%
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.990 line:93%
- Come here. Come here.
- What's he doing?

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.660 line:93%
What are you doing? You have to stand in line.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.000 line:93%
You want to stand in line? Okay.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.970 line:93%
I'm sorry.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:07.630 line:93%

No, bigger. This big!

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.320 line:93%
More, more!

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:35.000 line:93%
Wow. This is the first time I've seen one as big as this.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.880 line:93%
If it's any bigger, I could cover myself with it when I sleep.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.880 line:93%
You want to cover yourself with it when you sleep? Okay.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:25.690 line:93%
If you didn't wear the Geumganggo, you would have never found out about cotton candy.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:28.060 line:93%
Yes, yes. Thanks to you, I found out.

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.360 line:93%
I like this cotton ball. It's good.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.290 line:93%
It's the first time you've said you liked something because of me.

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:43.660 line:93%
You always said it's painful seeing me while wearing the Geumganggo.

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:47.810 line:93%
You said I'm the Five Elements Mountain that's crushing you.

So... you said you wanted me to disappear.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:46:00.420 line:93%
That's right. I think it would be good if you disappeared.

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:15.470 line:93%
When the Geumganggo disappears and all your feelings toward me disappear,

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:18.830 line:93%
will this cotton candy disappear, too?

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:21.710 line:93%
The memory of having said you liked that it's so sweet...

all of that will be erased away, right?

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.870 line:93%
Are you stupid? This will still exist.

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:36.580 line:93%
Even if not for Geumganggo's sake, what's sweet is sweet, and you like what you like.

Wow, it looks good.

Thanks.

Hey, what's wrong with our Oh Jeong?

I don't know.

Ma Wang isn't coming home today either I guess.

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.260 line:93%
It means detoxification is still not finished.

Hey! Why are you always here? Aren't you going home?

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:21.880 line:93%
Ah, I'm here helping out Bu Ja.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.690 line:93%
Oh, Bu Ja is practicing to go on the audition program.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:32.580 line:93%
Audition? Wow, it's amazing enough that a zombie watched TV, but you're going to appear on it?

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:39.080 line:93%
If I appear on the show, my family and friends might recognize me and try to call.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:43.150 line:93%
That's right. The enemy who killed you could recognize you and come find you.

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.710 line:93%
Rather than an enemy,

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:49.620 line:93%
I want to see my family.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.750 line:93%
Listen carefully. What are you going to do if you see your family when you're already a corpse?

00:49:54.750 --> 00:50:00.090 line:93%
Just find the enemy and get your revenge, then get buried.

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:02.260 line:93%
That's the cleanest way to handle it.

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:09.370 line:93%
Ah, seriously...

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:16.910 line:93%
But then again,

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.730 line:93%
I'm already dead.

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:24.660 line:93%
Don't worry. Even if you find your family, you won't have to be buried.

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:29.970 line:93%
I'll find a ton of energy stones for you. I'm a top star.

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:35.680 line:93%
Also... I think I'll become very strong.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:42.300 line:93%
At that time, I'll kick the butt of that horrible monkey.

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:46.130 line:93%
Jeo Pal Gye, thank you.

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.070 line:93%
Don't cry, okay?

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.020 line:93%
You want me to turn on the air conditioner?

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.240 line:93%
Sa Oh Jeong, where's the remote for the air conditioner?

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.050 line:93%
Sa Oh Jeong?

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:01.700 line:93%
Sa Oh Jeong! Sa Oh...

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:06.460 line:93%
What? You were here. Why didn't you answer when I called? What are you doing?

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:12.010 line:93%
What's the matter? Oh, did your stocks go down?

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:15.950 line:93%
The stain won't come off.

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:18.680 line:93%
Ah, just throw it out!

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:27.000 line:93%
Ma Wang, it's a relief your hands aren't shaking anymore.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.540 line:93%
The shaking has stopped, but there are still some slight side effects left.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.050 line:93%
Ma Wang.

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:49.710 line:93%
Until the side effects go away, I'll have to cancel all my appointments.

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:51.830 line:93%
I will take care of them.

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:54.500 line:93%
Did you find a strong detox medicine that will

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.840 line:93%
purify the blood of Sam Jang?

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.210 line:93%
I asked the grandson of the peddler to find me something.

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:02.460 line:93%
Hurry up and find it.

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:05.280 line:93%
It's totally embarrassing.

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:29.290 line:93%
<i>The medicine this time is dangerous. Be careful or he could die.</i>

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:40.260 line:93%
I can't have him take anything dangerous.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:52.730 line:93%
If a demon eats Sam Jang, how strong will he become?

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:58.910 line:93%
For example, if I were to take a bite of Sam Jang right now, would I be able to win against even the Great Sage?

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:01.200 line:93%
Why are you asking about that?

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:05.110 line:93%
You said you were going to go out with Sam Jang. Did you lose the nerve to do it?

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:08.630 line:93%
Come on, now. When did I say I was going to go out with Sam Jang?

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:10.330 line:93%
I've got no desire for that whatsoever!

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:14.610 line:93%
No matter what happens to Sam Jang, it doesn't matter one bit to me.

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:18.300 line:93%
Don't mess with Sam Jang.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.660 line:93%
If something happens to Sam Jang right now, it'll cause trouble for many of us.

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.250 line:93%
Sure, sure.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:27.760 line:93%
To start off, I wouldn't be able to get promoted,

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.070 line:93%
and Ma Wang wouldn't be able to become a deity.

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:34.740 line:93%
And the Great Sage would never be able to return to the heavenly realm.

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:38.360 line:93%
And Bu Ja would disappear as well.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.150 line:93%
What does Bu Ja have to do with Sam Jang?

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:45.000 line:93%
Bu Ja is a body woken from the dead by the power of Sam Jang's blood. A possessed corpse.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.380 line:93%
If Sam Jang is gone, then it's only a matter of course that Bu Ja would disappear as well.

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.230 line:93%
We can just keep feeding her energy stones.

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:53.790 line:93%
Have you seen a dead body survive on the strength of that alone?

00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:56.190 line:93%
She'll rot away in a day.

00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:00.080 line:93%
So if Sam Jang dies,

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:04.100 line:93%
Bu Ja is also going to die.

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:22.640 line:93%
Look. The rash that was here

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.710 line:93%
has moved down to here.

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:27.930 line:93%
Want to see it?

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:29.550 line:93%
No.

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:34.220 line:93%
Well, anyway, it's not visible when I'm wearing clothes so that's a relief.

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:43.600 line:93%
I'll put all of my being into making sure you never have to experience such side effects again.

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:57.970 line:93%
What is she being so serious for?

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:02.450 line:93%
How close are you?

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:05.100 line:93%
I'm just about there. Should I go straight to the chairman's office?

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:08.680 line:93%
No need. I'll come to meet you in the basement parking lot.

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.250 line:93%
Are you calling Sam Jang here?

00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:14.790 line:93%
Yes.

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:16.830 line:93%
For what purpose?

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.900 line:93%
I'm going to stab her.

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:26.590 line:93%
Once the scent of her blood spreads, Ma Wang won't be able to resist it anymore.

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:29.360 line:93%
- The Great Sage is likely to interfere though.
- I'll block him.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:32.850 line:93%
You should know well that you're no match for the Great Sage.

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:35.180 line:93%
Even if I die by his hands, it can still buy some time.

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:40.170 line:93%
Whether it's 5 seconds or 10 seconds, that's plenty enough time for Ma Wang.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.210 line:93%
Ma Wang.

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.120 line:93%
- Ma Wang!
- Ah, that startled me.

00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:39.500 line:93%
What?

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:43.800 line:93%
- T-The thing is...
- What is it?

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.730 line:93%
Secretary Ma, what did you need?

00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:56.120 line:93%
Sam Jang, I really do apologize for this.

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:06.390 line:93%
Sam Jang, I really do apologize for this.

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:26.420 line:93%
Ma Wang, that must hurt.

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:29.920 line:93%
Yeah. It hurts.

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:35.480 line:93%
Hey, you dog secretary. If you do something like this again, I'll kill you.

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.990 line:93%
She's not going to die by your hands.

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:42.660 line:93%
At the very least, she needs to die by my hands.

00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:46.500 line:93%
I apologize.

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:52.410 line:93%
Um, excuse me, demons?

00:57:52.410 --> 00:57:57.820 line:93%
I'm the only human here so I might not be understanding this situation right,

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:03.790 line:93%
but was Secretary Ma just trying to stab me?

00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:05.790 line:93%
- Yes.
- Why?

00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:09.550 line:93%
Because Ma Wang wants you.

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:13.390 line:93%
He does? Why?

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:20.100 line:93%
Because I drank some of your blood.

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.410 line:93%
How?

00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:25.550 line:93%
I gave it to him.

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:34.660 line:93%
Why did you do that?

00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:41.200 line:93%
Because you wished to get rid of me?

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:44.520 line:93%
Yeah.

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:17.070 line:93%
Ma Wang, are you in a lot of pain?

00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:25.700 line:93%
It's bearable. Besides, that punk looked like he's in more pain than I am.

00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:29.020 line:93%
He's the one that made this entire mess.

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.860 line:93%
Serves him damn right.

00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:38.240 line:93%
Ma Wang, I'm truly sorry.

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.380 line:93%
As you spoke of earlier, please kill me now.

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:44.770 line:93%
That's right. I'm going to kill you.

00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:48.080 line:93%
But not now.

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:51.020 line:93%
When I feel the time has come that I need to kill you,

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.700 line:93%
I'll pick a date and do it.

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:57.820 line:93%
Until that happens you're not allowed to be killed by anyone else.

00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:59.670 line:93%
That's an order.

00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:01.720 line:93%
Ma Wang.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:08.390 line:93%
Don't ever try to kill without my permission again.

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:10.550 line:93%
Yes, sir.

01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:22.730 line:93%
<i>You're another Five Elements Mountain to me.</i>

01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:25.290 line:93%
<i>I'd like it if you disappeared.</i>

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:29.440 line:93%

How could I let myself be fooled by a liar and do something so stupid?

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:39.300 line:93%
Where is it? It was somewhere around here.

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:57.540 line:93%
So it was you? The evil spirit cutting people's hair.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:01.480 line:93%
I love the hair that contains the sadness of love.

01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:07.170 line:93%
If I cut your hair, you won't hurt one bit anymore.

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:13.700 line:93%
There won't be one ounce of your feelings for him left. Give it to me.

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:18.160 line:93%
My feelings for him will completely go away?

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:34.120 line:93%
<i>If this isn't love, then what is?</i>

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.210 line:93%
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:40.680 line:93%
<i>I said I'd do everything you want for you.</i>

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.460 line:93%
<i>I like this cotton ball. It's good.</i>

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:46.390 line:93%
I don't want them to go away.

<i>Son Oh Gong.</i>

01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:05.420 line:93%
Go to a hairdresser's to get your hair cut.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:08.590 line:93%
Although you'll be pretty to me no matter how it's cut.

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:11.020 line:93%
Because I love you.

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:14.370 line:93%
I don't care how it looks to you.

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:18.470 line:93%
All you need to do is make sure that I, as Sam Jang, am never gotten rid of.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.920 line:93%
As you command, I'll protect you.

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.790 line:93%
I got the stain out!

01:03:56.790 --> 01:04:00.400 line:93%
Like I thought, it was a good idea to ask on that housewives site!

01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:04.010 line:93%
I should leave a review.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.400 line:93%
Hey, Secretary Ma! How's Ma Wang doing?

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.890 line:93%
Go away, you tattletale pig.

01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:16.020 line:93%
Aigoo, why do you have to be like that?

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:21.660 line:93%
If I hadn't snitched to Ma Wang, you'd be dead by the Great Sage's hand by now.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.650 line:93%
Jeo Pal Gye, why did you do that?

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:29.680 line:93%
You were drooling while asking me to give you one bite, yet why did you change your mind?

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.140 line:93%
It was just to get one bite, so it wasn't worth the risk.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:37.890 line:93%
You should have been a little more generous when enticing a pig, no?

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.640 line:93%
Oh, Bu Ja! You're done?

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.240 line:93%
I practiced hard again today.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.590 line:93%
Good job. Let's go. I'll take you home.

01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:11.900 line:93%
Your cooking today is especially good.

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.400 line:93%
I put in some extra effort.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.660 line:93%
You seem like you're in a good mood today.

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:19.440 line:93%
Yes. I figured out how to get rid of a stain that was bothering me.

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.920 line:93%
You didn't throw it away and cleaned it instead?

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.200 line:93%
Wow. You're amazing.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.250 line:93%
I called Unnie over since you cooked so much,

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.490 line:93%
but she says she's not coming.

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:42.470 line:93%
I wonder why Sam Jang... said she wouldn't come?

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:48.310 line:93%
I guess she didn't want to eat with a traitor at the same table.

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:53.130 line:93%
How could she eat at the same table with a predator?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.530 line:93%
Did the two of you do something bad to Unnie?

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:12.060 line:93%
The stain is harder to wash off the longer you wait.

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:16.710 line:93%
The two of you, please resolve it quickly.

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:23.520 line:93%
<i>What?</i>

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.220 line:93%
<i>What?</i>

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.920 line:93%
I took a very strong detox medicine.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.670 line:93%
I won't be dangerous anymore,

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:39.850 line:93%
so you don't need to avoid me.

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:45.090 line:93%
But when you change your mind, you can hurt me at any time.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:52.450 line:93%
There is someone I have to save, and I need you in order to save that person.

01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:55.550 line:93%
You are still very useful to me,

01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:59.110 line:93%
so I will never hurt you. Trust me.

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.390 line:93%
Secretary Ma.

01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:06.700 line:93%
Sam Jang, I'm sorry.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:10.970 line:93%
Since Ma Wang tells me not to, I won't do it anymore.

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:17.840 line:93%
She's apologizing, but I don't feel that she's sorry.

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:26.280 line:93%
Well, I guess I can't expect feelings from an evil spirit.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:33.240 line:93%
I'll let this pass with the belief that should this happen again, you'll get stabbed in my place.

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:23.270 line:93%
CEO, have some ice cream.

01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:25.880 line:93%
He bought it for me?

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:32.340 line:93%
No one came. I got this for you.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.440 line:93%
I see, you waited for Secretary Son.

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:40.280 line:93%
I didn't wait for him. Why would I?

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.260 line:93%
Ah, you fought with your boyfriend, so he doesn't even buy you ice cream.

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:44.940 line:93%
He, he's not my boyfriend.

01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:49.880 line:93%
Right. It's very disappointing when you're used to him always buying it for you and then he suddenly doesn't.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.020 line:93%
I guess you don't even want to see this ice cream.

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:54.620 line:93%
What is he to me that I wouldn't like ice cream?

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:56.770 line:93%
It has nothing to do with it.

01:08:56.770 --> 01:09:00.090 line:93%
- Then have some.
- Never mind.

01:09:06.150 --> 01:09:11.620 line:93%
Oh... that idiot must be playing with the CEO's heart...

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:16.150 line:93%
After buying her a mere strawberry ice cream, he hasn't done crap for her.

01:09:16.150 --> 01:09:18.690 line:93%
I'll eat it.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.010 line:93%
Why did the chair...

01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:29.240 line:93%
Theory of parallel?

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:35.200 line:93%
Crap? I've done so much for her!

01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:41.440 line:93%
Hyungnim, it'll be too late now that Wa Mang has completely detoxified.

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.030 line:93%
Today was the best time. It's too bad.

01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:49.150 line:93%
Ma Wang is done detoxifying, but Sam Jang really hates me now.

01:09:49.150 --> 01:09:51.060 line:93%
Comfort her.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:54.780 line:93%
I did. I told her she's pretty and that I love her, but she hates me even more.

01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:57.330 line:93%
It's because you're not being sincere.

01:09:57.330 --> 01:10:00.890 line:93%
How can there be sincerity to an evil spirit who's wearing the Geumganggo?

01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:04.830 line:93%
But Sam Jang has sincerity since she's human.

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:12.050 line:93%
Look into her heart and see why she hates you more.

01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:14.310 line:93%
That way, you can make her feel better.

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:24.630 line:93%
First, thank you very much.
<i>[Wooja]</i>

01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:28.380 line:93%
Thank you for working with Dragon Studios.

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:33.910 line:93%
No, no. The fact that we're able to work with the big global movie director Bong Sang Woo

01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:36.080 line:93%
is an honor for us.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:42.300 line:93%
Thank you. The movie Wooja that you will be working with Director Bong Sang Woo is, as you know,

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.660 line:93%
it's gonna be fantastic.

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:50.260 line:93%
It's a fantasy about a friendship between a big white bull and a little girl.

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:52.800 line:93%
White bull. A white bull.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.680 line:93%
I liked that part very much, and it's the reason I wanted to get involved in the production.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.850 line:93%
I heard the title character is a Korean girl.

01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:03.230 line:93%
What kind of actress do you want?

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:07.320 line:93%
There's an image of a little girl I suggested to Director Bong.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:13.250 line:93%
To be honest, when I was young, the mysterious girl I met in Korea

01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:16.140 line:93%
became the motif for this movie.

01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:20.130 line:93%
Ah, you have a clear image of her.

01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:26.030 line:93%
Yeah. She was extraordinary.

01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:33.250 line:93%
It's so clear in my head that I can draw her image at any given moment.

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:45.130 line:93%
When I was young, I saw her at Lotus Village or something in Gangwondo.

01:11:45.130 --> 01:11:48.080 line:93%
She's the girl I met at that time.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:52.150 line:93%
She always carried a yellow umbrella.

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:58.160 line:93%
An umbrella?

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.220 line:93%
<i>You must be punished!</i>

01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:10.750 line:93%
<i>Will you trade umbrellas with me?</i>

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:17.280 line:93%
Why have you remembered this girl for so long?

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.510 line:93%
She was my first love.

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:27.200 line:93%
First love?

01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:33.030 line:93%
First love.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.850 line:93%
Son Oh Gong just came by.

01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:59.160 line:93%
I didn't come to find him.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.820 line:93%
I just came to have some ice cream I like.

01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:11.540 line:93%
It's an hourglass. Does the ice cream come out within this time?

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:15.170 line:93%
I'm slow, so I can't make that happen in that time.

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:21.820 line:93%
I head you dislike Son Oh Gong very much.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.460 line:93%
I have no reason to dislike him.

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:28.520 line:93%
His heart isn't even genuine.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:33.270 line:93%
Sam Jang, would you like me to buy you some time?

01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:39.150 line:93%
I don't have the ability to make ice cream quickly,

01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:43.790 line:93%
but I can hold onto the Geumganggo for this much time.

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:49.140 line:93%
Today, the strongest cold wave is coming, so my power is at its peak.

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:54.330 line:93%
I think I can freeze the power of Gumganggo for at least this much time.

01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:58.600 line:93%
It's a chance to find out his true feelings,

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:04.190 line:93%
so if you get that short moment, what would you like to know?
