(Episode 29)

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.280 line:93%
- Hello? - Dong Tak.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.480 line:93%
I just got the result.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.089 line:93%
It didn't match.

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:24.289 line:93%
The guy in that helmet wasn't Prosecutor Tak.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.379 line:93%
It...

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:46.650 line:93%
really wasn't you?

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.519 line:93%
(Security Footage Analysis)

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.999 line:93%
I found you.

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:08.270 line:93%
The real angel.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.939 line:93%
- It's been a long time! - We've missed you!

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.150 line:93%
You.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.120 line:93%
You were the black helmet?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.749 line:93%
The little kid...

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.919 line:93%
that Doo Sik used to have a crush on?

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.100 line:93%
Did Doo Sik know...

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.529 line:93%
that you were the culprit from the beginning?

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:42.040 line:93%
I know the helmet.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.740 line:93%
That's why I got the tattoo.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.910 line:93%
Is that why...

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.010 line:93%
Doo Sik took the blame for you...

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.609 line:93%
like an idiot?

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.410 line:93%
He didn't take the blame...

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:55.279 line:93%
to have a better life for himself?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.219 line:93%
Was it you?

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.350 line:93%
Was it all because of you?

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:05.790 line:93%
You killed Detective Jo, Kim Jong Doo,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.699 line:93%
and even attempted to kill me.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.130 line:93%
Why?

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.040 line:93%
Why did you do that?

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.679 line:93%
Are you here to see the mural again?

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.179 line:93%
Is the director doing well?

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.359 line:93%
I have no idea what's going on,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.459 line:93%
but she was seen on the hospital's security footage.

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.459 line:93%
She's the one who attacked...

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.060 line:93%
Soo Chang.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.299 line:93%
(Security Footage Analysis)

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.769 line:93%
Dong Tak.

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.209 line:93%
Hello? Hey, Detective Cha.

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.119 line:93%
- Speak. - Captain Yoo says...

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.419 line:93%
the DNA we found from the superintendent's nail...

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.190 line:93%
belongs to a woman.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.090 line:93%
It looks like the person who killed Hang Joon is a woman.

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:14.660 line:93%
The one who killed Hang Joon...

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.030 line:93%
and came after Soo Chang and me...

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.850 line:93%
The one who attacked Superintendent Ma.

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:39.350 line:93%
She's the owner.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.489 line:93%
Our owner can't hear or speak.

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.130 line:93%
That person was this woman?

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.820 line:93%
Captain Yoo.

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.660 line:93%
I know where the person in the helmet is.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.259 line:93%
I need backup.

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.200 line:93%
Do you like this mural that much?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.369 line:93%
Is that why you got a tattoo of this behind your neck?

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.080 line:93%
You cried so much when you first came here.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.749 line:93%
Back then,

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:41.450 line:93%
I told you that...

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.720 line:93%
your parents are probably...

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.989 line:93%
keeping their eyes on you...

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:49.359 line:93%
from up there with wings like those.

00:04:49.359 --> 00:04:51.230 line:93%
That's when you stopped crying.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.189 line:93%
Right.

00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:55.799 line:93%
Have you heard from Doo Sik?

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.100 line:93%
He hasn't been coming for a while.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.270 line:93%
He died.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.239 line:93%
That idiot died.

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:04.640 line:93%
He took the blame for your murder...

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:09.210 line:93%
and died in prison...

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.950 line:93%
like an idiot.

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:15.280 line:93%
Are you leaving already?

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.020 line:93%
Drive safely.

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.359 line:93%
No. Where are you going?

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:24.530 line:93%
You can't leave.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.530 line:93%
Never.

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.540 line:93%
What's going on?

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.439 line:93%
What's wrong with me?

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.129 line:93%
Darn it. She already took off.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.359 line:93%
Find some DNA samples,

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:04.770 line:93%
then check if it matches the one we got from Superintendent Ma.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.830 line:93%
Yes, sir.

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:10.770 line:93%
Please stay here.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.309 line:93%
What's this place?

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.559 line:93%
What is that?

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.230 line:93%
Take these.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.299 line:93%
("Incheon Car Accident Witness Says the Truck Drove Over the Center.")

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:47.980 line:93%
("The Only Survivor, the Perpetrator's Son")

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.210 line:93%
What's all this?

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:10.700 line:93%
("Killed on Their Way to Pick Up Their Daughter")

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.499 line:93%
Then the married couple who died in the accident were...

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:15.640 line:93%
Yes, Captain Yoo.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.910 line:93%
The suspect is Jin Soo A, a 30-year-old.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.080 line:93%
She's not in her registered address.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.040 line:93%
We looked everywhere for her, but she's nowhere to be found.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.580 line:93%
That's what's going on here too.

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:27.549 line:93%
Maybe she found out somehow and ran.

00:07:27.549 --> 00:07:30.819 line:93%
Is that so? She came back to Korea from Japan a year ago.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.919 line:93%
She's from an orphanage.

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:34.419 line:93%
An orphanage?

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.960 line:93%
Yes, okay.

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.600 line:93%
I think I know where she is.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.270 line:93%
Can you find more information about her?

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.040 line:93%
Sure.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.109 line:93%
Let's take everything we see in this place.

00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:54.210 line:93%
- Okay. - Okay.

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:58.210 line:93%
It wasn't Tak Jae Hee.

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:02.379 line:93%
I was wrong.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.049 line:93%
Superintendent Ma was wrong too.

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:10.290 line:93%
We were all wrong.

00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:15.400 line:93%
The angel's wings I saw at Soo Chang's old orphanage.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.770 line:93%
Then Lee Doo Sik and Jin Soo A.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.100 line:93%
Everything is connected to that orphanage.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.580 line:93%
Why did she do this?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.249 line:93%
Why?

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.300 line:93%
Why are you sitting here like this?

00:08:53.869 --> 00:08:54.940 line:93%
I...

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.869 line:93%
saw that person in the black helmet.

00:08:57.869 --> 00:08:59.509 line:93%
She had the tattoo too.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:02.840 line:93%
It was the little girl Doo Sik had a crush on.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.980 line:93%
It's Jin Soo A, isn't it?

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.320 line:93%
What brings you here again?

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.989 line:93%
The person who comes here to see the angel's wings...

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.619 line:93%
The same person who has a tattoo of that on her neck...

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.859 line:93%
killed two people to this point and is willing to kill more.

00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:26.769 line:93%
Jin Soo A.

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:31.539 line:93%
- Why would she... - Where is she right now?

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:32.909 line:93%
Soo A...

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.749 line:93%
I have no idea.

00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:41.680 line:93%
She's lying. She was just here.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.420 line:93%
I know that she was just here.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.989 line:93%
Someone saw her, and I checked her credit card transaction.

00:09:46.989 --> 00:09:50.220 line:93%
There's really no telling in where she'll be.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.129 line:93%
- Where is she? - I don't know.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.300 line:93%
I need a lead, ma'am.

00:10:05.369 --> 00:10:07.409 line:93%
What kind of a person is she?

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.580 line:93%
She lost...

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.450 line:93%
both of her parents at once,

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.519 line:93%
then shut off her mouth and ears...

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.720 line:93%
because of that shock.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.850 line:93%
She's a very weak person.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.289 line:93%
She barely ever socialized with others.

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:23.460 line:93%
But still,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.659 line:93%
if you gave her a little bit of love,

00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:28.330 line:93%
she would blindly return it back to you.

00:10:28.499 --> 00:10:30.259 line:93%
Yes, she was pretty odd.

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:32.470 line:93%
She was there, but it felt like she never was.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.539 line:93%
Director Tak Jung Hwan's special donation.

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:40.840 line:93%
Was she the one who received that donation?

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:43.609 line:93%
How did you know...

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:49.320 line:93%
What does that have to do with this?

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.019 line:93%
I'm sure Director Tak made her like that.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.259 line:93%
- What do you mean? - If you don't stop her now,

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.389 line:93%
she might kill another person.

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:03.359 line:93%
We have to get her right now.

00:11:12.609 --> 00:11:15.080 line:93%
Do you think she knows something?

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.550 line:93%
Even if she does, she won't open up easily. She seemed concerned.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.879 line:93%
And Tak Jae Hee.

00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:25.149 line:93%
He didn't seem to know anything.

00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:27.460 line:93%
I don't know what's going on,

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.190 line:93%
but she's the person who attacked Gong Soo Chang.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.659 line:93%
Based on what Jo Min Seok and Superintendent Ma said,

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.369 line:93%
for one reason or another, Tak Jung Hwan tried to cover it up.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.239 line:93%
If Director Tak trained Jin Soo A...

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:48.980 line:93%
If that's the case, she most likely killed on his order.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.440 line:93%
I don't get it.

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:52.409 line:93%
What about me?

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:53.950 line:93%
Why me?

00:11:54.619 --> 00:11:55.950 line:93%
Her parents...

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.019 line:93%
were the couple who died in the Incheon five-way car crash.

00:12:03.359 --> 00:12:06.129 line:93%
You weren't the only victim of that accident.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.529 line:93%
The couple in the victim's car.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.670 line:93%
They had a family member left behind.

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:20.840 line:93%
Like you, Soo Chang.

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.480 line:93%
She thought my dad had killed them...

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.649 line:93%
and wanted revenge?

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:35.759 line:93%
Captain.

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:38.159 line:93%
Security footage, credit cards, account details...

00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:39.629 line:93%
We're pulling everything.

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:42.200 line:93%
She killed two people already.

00:12:42.499 --> 00:12:43.930 line:93%
She could try to go abroad.

00:12:43.999 --> 00:12:47.170 line:93%
She won't run away. She didn't kill for money.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.539 line:93%
She has...

00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:53.170 line:93%
leftover business.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.409 line:93%
So please keep looking.

00:12:56.409 --> 00:12:57.680 line:93%
Okay, take care.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.019 line:93%
Get everything you can think of.

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:03.420 line:93%
- Okay. - Yes, sir.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.420 line:93%
Where has Dokgo been all day?

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.519 line:93%
Dokgo, there's something strange on it.

00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:18.869 line:93%
What's this?

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.670 line:93%
How much does Tak Jae Hee know?

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:24.710 line:93%
Based on his reaction from earlier,

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.609 line:93%
he didn't seem to know what Jin Soo A had done.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.619 line:93%
- Hello? - I have the results.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.859 line:93%
The DNA from the superintendent's fingernails...

00:13:40.859 --> 00:13:43.060 line:93%
match what we got off Jin Soo A's belongings.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.090 line:93%
She's definitely the culprit.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.330 line:93%
Okay, thanks.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.350 line:93%
Father...

00:14:07.109 --> 00:14:09.080 line:93%
is hiding something from me.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.830 line:93%
You asked about Jin Soo A.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.600 line:93%
We checked the special account she was sponsored through.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.239 line:93%
I think you should see it for yourself.

00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:36.509 line:93%
(Tak Jung Hwan)

00:14:38.409 --> 00:14:39.550 line:93%
I see.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.820 line:93%
Keep me updated on how far he gets.

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:47.350 line:93%
Yes, sir.

00:14:55.374 --> 00:15:00.374 line:93%
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E29 Two Cops "Real Angel"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.980 line:93%
The woman at Ilya. How do you know her?

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.149 line:93%
I sponsored her...

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.279 line:93%
for a long time.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.619 line:93%
Maybe not as much as you,

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.749 line:93%
but she's very special to me.

00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:22.759 line:93%
Do you know the police have identified her as a murder suspect?

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:24.190 line:93%
I had no idea.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:25.590 line:93%
Jo Hang Joon.

00:15:26.129 --> 00:15:27.430 line:93%
Kim Jong Doo.

00:15:27.859 --> 00:15:29.899 line:93%
- And now... - What is your point?

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.200 line:93%
If you're involved with this case...

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.230 line:93%
No.

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:36.100 line:93%
I do...

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.180 line:93%
believe you.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.379 line:93%
I do not believe it.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.350 line:93%
Did she really commit murder?

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:52.489 line:93%
Even if that were true...

00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:54.720 line:93%
and even if...

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.389 line:93%
it started off with so much as a cough from me,

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:07.170 line:93%
what if it were all for you?

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.409 line:93%
What will you do then?

00:16:12.909 --> 00:16:14.109 line:93%
Father, I...

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:17.340 line:93%
If I must pay, yes.

00:16:18.009 --> 00:16:19.550 line:93%
If it really comes to that,

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.149 line:93%
I'll take responsibility.

00:16:24.619 --> 00:16:25.720 line:93%
Okay.

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:31.289 line:93%
No parent...

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.060 line:93%
would let their child get wet.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:40.570 line:93%
But Jae Hee.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:43.700 line:93%
This time,

00:16:44.609 --> 00:16:45.970 line:93%
I got wet.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.109 line:93%
What must I do about it?

00:16:51.109 --> 00:16:52.249 line:93%
You must...

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.279 line:93%
protect her.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.829 line:93%
Do you think Tak Jae Hee will give you the arrest warrant?

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.499 line:93%
Even though we doubted him, he's still a prosecutor.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.170 line:93%
What you got without a warrant...

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:21.980 line:93%
can't be used as evidence.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.549 line:93%
We did what we had to do to compare the DNAs.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:26.880 line:93%
Detective Cha.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.950 line:93%
You doubted me,

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.220 line:93%
and I'll drop that.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.019 line:93%
But I can't let you go against the rules.

00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:38.360 line:93%
Is that the real reason?

00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:42.930 line:93%
Is it not because it leads to Tak Jung Hwan?

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.430 line:93%
He can't admit that...

00:17:44.599 --> 00:17:46.430 line:93%
his father is a scumbag.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.269 line:93%
I won't issue an arrest warrant or a travel ban.

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:52.210 line:93%
And the DNA results won't be admitted.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:53.940 line:93%
All right then.

00:17:54.809 --> 00:17:58.150 line:93%
- If that's all, you can leave. - I apologize for suspecting you,

00:17:58.849 --> 00:18:00.009 line:93%
but...

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.589 line:93%
you shouldn't forget the cause...

00:18:09.819 --> 00:18:11.860 line:93%
of the traffic accident 16 years ago.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:14.829 line:93%
Do not forget that.

00:18:18.099 --> 00:18:19.400 line:93%
Especially you.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.249 line:93%
Helmet girl.

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:34.049 line:93%
What if she goes into hiding?

00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:53.200 line:93%
(Locker)

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.839 line:93%
Select your locker.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:12.890 line:93%
Mr. Oh.

00:19:13.349 --> 00:19:14.519 line:93%
When you come over,

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.029 line:93%
please bring the photographs from the Incheon junction...

00:19:18.489 --> 00:19:20.059 line:93%
traffic accident from 16 years ago.

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:24.059 line:93%
Thank you.

00:19:29.569 --> 00:19:30.599 line:93%
Hello.

00:19:31.269 --> 00:19:33.440 line:93%
- I'm hungry. - Come in.

00:19:38.009 --> 00:19:40.180 line:93%
I thought I would die. I feel better now.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.779 line:93%
Why didn't you eat dinner?

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.819 line:93%
I wanted to ask your dad...

00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:46.489 line:93%
some questions over dinner, but he isn't in.

00:19:46.489 --> 00:19:47.819 line:93%
- My father? - Yes.

00:19:48.819 --> 00:19:50.420 line:93%
You know my dad's case, right?

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.160 line:93%
Of course. It's the reason you became a reporter.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.529 line:93%
I'm looking into it again.

00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:58.670 line:93%
I asked Detective Cha and your dad for help.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.400 line:93%
The case Detective Cha is on...

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.170 line:93%
is connected to my dad's last case.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.980 line:93%
If he can solve this one, it might help solve my dad's case.

00:20:10.079 --> 00:20:13.110 line:93%
- Really? - Your dad said something odd today.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.620 line:93%
There's so little evidence left.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.690 line:93%
The witness is dead too.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.589 line:93%
He said the witness was dead.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.960 line:93%
But my dad's case...

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.860 line:93%
had no witnesses.

00:20:26.529 --> 00:20:28.299 line:93%
That's what I wanted to ask.

00:20:28.759 --> 00:20:31.970 line:93%
He must be busy because he's about to become a minister.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.140 line:93%
Yes, I guess so.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.710 line:93%
He went from cop to prosecutor...

00:20:37.839 --> 00:20:40.779 line:93%
and now to Minister of Justice. He's incredible.

00:20:42.279 --> 00:20:44.249 line:93%
What do you think of him?

00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:47.380 line:93%
- What? - Not the boring stuff...

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.749 line:93%
you get online.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.390 line:93%
What do you think he's like?

00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:56.390 line:93%
- I don't know. - What?

00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:58.660 line:93%
What about you?

00:20:59.589 --> 00:21:01.559 line:93%
- What? - What are you like?

00:21:04.829 --> 00:21:05.970 line:93%
Jin Soo A.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.200 line:93%
She committed murder twice already.

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:13.610 line:93%
If she followed Tak Jung Hwan so blindly, why...

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.809 line:93%
- Detective Cha. - Anyway,

00:21:16.009 --> 00:21:19.509 line:93%
if we get Jin Soo A's testimony that she's been forced to commit murder,

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.779 line:93%
we'll be able to get the director.

00:21:21.779 --> 00:21:23.450 line:93%
I think, Detective Cha,

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.650 line:93%
something strange is happening to me.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.690 line:93%
What?

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.620 line:93%
I think...

00:21:31.989 --> 00:21:33.890 line:93%
my body is disappearing.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.700 line:93%
What?

00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:44.440 line:93%
Gosh, it's better now.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.640 line:93%
Why is it like that?

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:47.410 line:93%
I don't know.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.640 line:93%
But it's worse than last time.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.110 line:93%
Wait. It's not the first time? When did it start happening?

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.220 line:93%
It started...

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.420 line:93%
when we were at the police station.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.690 line:93%
Is he always jealous or what?

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.519 line:93%
And then, it happened at the orphanage.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.230 line:93%
I...

00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:08.099 line:93%
What's wrong with me?

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.499 line:93%
Wait.

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:12.200 line:93%
I... I'm not seeing things, right?

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.200 line:93%
I saw my hand disappear too.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.239 line:93%
What should we do? Why is this happening?

00:22:17.239 --> 00:22:19.170 line:93%
I don't know. I don't...

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.710 line:93%
Right. Miss Bong might know.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.980 line:93%
Disappearance.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.089 line:93%
What?

00:22:32.489 --> 00:22:34.390 line:93%
Is he going to disappear forever?

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.259 line:93%
So I'm not just going to die?

00:22:36.259 --> 00:22:37.960 line:93%
I'm going to disappear like smoke?

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.259 line:93%
In a few days, the 49 days you had will be over.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.630 line:93%
You don't have much time.

00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:46.730 line:93%
Do something.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.339 line:93%
You trust me, right?

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.640 line:93%
Then trust me until the end.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.440 line:93%
But there...

00:22:58.749 --> 00:22:59.809 line:93%
Hey.

00:23:00.349 --> 00:23:01.680 line:93%
Later...

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.019 line:93%
A little later, something will happen that will make you cry.

00:23:06.019 --> 00:23:08.259 line:93%
But don't blame yourself.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.489 line:93%
That's what destiny is like.

00:23:11.489 --> 00:23:13.289 line:93%
It's always so mean.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:14.999 line:93%
It'd have been better...

00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:18.370 line:93%
if you hadn't got to know that person.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:27.110 line:93%
(Seoul Central Police Station)

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.640 line:93%
Why are you here?

00:23:29.309 --> 00:23:31.180 line:93%
I came to lend you this.

00:23:34.249 --> 00:23:37.890 line:93%
- I had a rough day. - That's why I'm here.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.190 line:93%
By the way, I met Jae Hee.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.519 line:93%
I went to see Jung Hwan, but he wasn't in.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.289 line:93%
He had told me something strange.

00:23:46.289 --> 00:23:48.700 line:93%
He said that the witness to my dad's accident had died.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.200 line:93%
But there was no witness to my dad's accident.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.539 line:93%
He told you that the witness had died?

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.970 line:93%
Yes.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.809 line:93%
Why?

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.279 line:93%
It's nothing.

00:24:09.349 --> 00:24:12.450 line:93%
How's Soo Chang?

00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:15.420 line:93%

He's doing fine.

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.700 line:93%
It's good to hear that.

"Strong flour, sugar, dry..."

00:24:32.239 --> 00:24:34.809 line:93%
Strong flour might be too much.

00:24:34.809 --> 00:24:37.380 line:93%
"Shape the dough, and bake it on a saucepan."

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:41.120 line:93%
"Then you'll have made some wavy chocolate cream."

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.980 line:93%
This is what you like best.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.960 line:93%
Do you think I'll be able to catch the culprit?

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:56.999 line:93%
Will I be able to go back into my body?

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.430 line:93%
It's easy.

00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:03.069 line:93%
I'll make it for you.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.769 line:93%
"Corn bread. Prepare a meat slice,"

00:25:06.769 --> 00:25:10.950 line:93%
"and put ham, corn, onion, and green pepper."

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.349 line:93%
This time, I got wet.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.190 line:93%
What would I do with my wet clothes?

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:20.150 line:93%
You have...

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:22.089 line:93%

"But he called me at 8pm, saying he's going to be late."

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.180 line:93%
Before he called me,

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.309 line:93%
he could have called someone.

00:25:47.309 --> 00:25:49.980 line:93%
Why didn't I think of this before?

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.220 line:93%
If I find the person he had been talking to at that time,

00:25:52.589 --> 00:25:55.789 line:93%
there's a high possibility that person might know something.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.460 line:93%
I'll need to find that person first.

Just hang in there, Soo Chang.

00:26:28.989 --> 00:26:30.690 line:93%
- You should have some coffee. - Thanks.

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:38.430 line:93%
I need to listen again.

Hello.

00:27:26.309 --> 00:27:28.220 line:93%
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.749 line:93%
I'm not dead yet.

(Tracking Situation of the Suspect, Jin Soo A)

Gosh, we were on stakeout all night, but we got nothing.

00:27:49.069 --> 00:27:52.670 line:93%
I know. Maybe we lost her.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.440 line:93%
Where's Dokgo? Why isn't he here?

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:58.309 line:93%
This lighter.

00:27:59.809 --> 00:28:02.450 line:93%
- What? - It wasn't just any lighter.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.589 line:93%
Please concentrate.

00:28:14.599 --> 00:28:17.730 line:93%
It starts now.

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:30.880 line:93%
I thought you had been compensated enough.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.420 line:93%
I spent all that money. I have none left anymore.

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.049 line:93%
So you want more?

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:40.349 line:93%
The statute of limitations has expired.

00:28:40.349 --> 00:28:42.720 line:93%
If I say...

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.489 line:93%
Won't they investigate again?

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:55.569 line:93%
I see.

- I'll call you in three days. - I'll be waiting.

00:28:59.239 --> 00:29:02.980 line:93%
I'll be waiting at... In three days.

00:29:03.779 --> 00:29:06.980 line:93%
Hey. What's all this about?

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.880 line:93%
So someone committed murder, right?

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.989 line:93%
No way.

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:15.120 line:93%
It was a recorder that looked like a lighter.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.989 line:93%
There's a bit of static,

00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:19.529 line:93%
but I'll find out...

00:29:19.529 --> 00:29:22.700 line:93%
who was on that recorder in no time...

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.730 line:93%
by analyzing the components.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.970 line:93%
You don't need to. It's Director Tak.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.739 line:93%
It's me. How have you been?

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:39.079 line:93%
There's been a burglary at my house a few days ago.

00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:42.420 line:93%
The burglar went through everything, but nothing went missing.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.989 line:93%
- So I didn't report to the police. - A burglar?

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:47.819 line:93%
But there was something weird.

00:29:48.989 --> 00:29:50.519 line:93%
Hang Joon's urn?

00:29:50.519 --> 00:29:52.690 line:93%
The janitor called and said...

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.460 line:93%
someone had searched through it.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.529 line:93%
He warned me not to put any valuables in there.

00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:59.029 line:93%
When did this happen?

00:29:59.029 --> 00:30:02.400 line:93%
Here it is. December 5, 2017.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.410 line:93%
This is where his urn is, right?

00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:06.940 line:93%
Dongducheon gas station. She refueled here.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:07.980 line:93%
All right.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.239 line:93%
Thank you. I'll go visit Jun Soo soon.

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:12.549 line:93%
Jin Soo A...

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.980 line:93%
must have been looking for this.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.890 line:93%
This is why Director Tak had to kill Hang Joon.

00:30:23.259 --> 00:30:24.460 line:93%
His secret...

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.700 line:93%
was hidden inside this lighter.

00:30:28.759 --> 00:30:29.900 line:93%
Right.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.269 line:93%
This is what Detective Jo found...

00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:34.029 line:93%
at the place of Kim Jong Doo's incident.

00:30:34.069 --> 00:30:37.140 line:93%
That's also why she ransacked the police station,

00:30:37.339 --> 00:30:39.769 line:93%
his house, and his urn.

00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:43.239 line:93%
If Kim Jong Doo had simply been a witness to a car accident,

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.779 line:93%
Director Tak wouldn't have had to silence him.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.319 line:93%
The statute of limitations for the destruction of evidence...

00:30:50.319 --> 00:30:52.519 line:93%
of the car accident 16 years ago has already been expired.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.289 line:93%
It was too weak to be a reason for him to want to kill him.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.390 line:93%
But if this is about murder, it's a different story.

00:31:08.839 --> 00:31:10.039 line:93%
I haven't...

00:31:10.739 --> 00:31:13.110 line:93%
- quit smoking yet. - Kim Jong Doo...

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.739 line:93%
went to Director Tak...

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:17.110 line:93%
right after returning back to Korea.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.210 line:93%
He knew Director Tak would do a body search on him,

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.819 line:93%
and of course, he'd take away his phone too.

00:31:22.849 --> 00:31:24.890 line:93%
He probably had to come up with an idea.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.460 line:93%
And he probably threatened him...

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.430 line:93%
with that voice recording.

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.499 line:93%
You can't be like this.

00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:38.670 line:93%
I have a voice recording of you.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.700 line:93%
Come on, Director Tak. This is very unlike you.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.940 line:93%
How much do you want?

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.640 line:93%
But there's something that Kim didn't know.

00:31:46.339 --> 00:31:49.380 line:93%
Director Tak had something which he didn't have...

00:31:49.739 --> 00:31:51.049 line:93%
16 years ago.

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:53.210 line:93%
Jin Soo A.

00:31:55.234 --> 00:31:56.834 line:93%
