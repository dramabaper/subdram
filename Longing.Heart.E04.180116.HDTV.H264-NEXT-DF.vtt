Shin Woo!

3
00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:40.174
Ugh, Kang Shin Woo,

4
00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:41.716
[Episode 4]
that crazy bastard!

5
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.204
Seriously, what's with him?

6
00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:45.252
Ugh, that damn bastard.

7
00:00:45.252 --> 00:00:46.420
Why don't you smoke outside?

8
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.192
Let's go to an internet cafe!

9
00:00:48.192 --> 00:00:49.314
An internet cafe... ow!

10
00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:51.070
Don't you ever have any better ideas?

11
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.631
But that's my favorite place!

12
00:00:54.192 --> 00:00:55.734
Hey, wait.

13
00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:08.826
Whatever.

14
00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:10.516
It's...

15
00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.579
a losing game, anyway.

16
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:28.087
Let's go to the school dumpster.

17
00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.885
The school dumpster?
Why, is there something there?

18
00:01:31.713 --> 00:01:32.819
Let's follow him.

19
00:01:46.718 --> 00:01:48.268
Mr. Kang.

20
00:01:49.387 --> 00:01:50.893
You still haven't left?

21
00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:53.503
I was just about to leave.

22
00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:57.003
Oh, good timing.
I have something to return to you.

23
00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:07.451
Mr. Kang.

24
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:10.719
Now, I'll say what
I should've said yesterday.

25
00:02:14.448 --> 00:02:16.223
To me, you are...

26
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:18.711
a precious disciple.

27
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.730
That's what you are to me now,
and what you will always be.

28
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.387
That's my answer to the
problem you asked me to solve.

29
00:02:30.682 --> 00:02:32.407
Don't get the wrong idea.

30
00:02:33.502 --> 00:02:35.674
I'm not crying because
that's the wrong answer.

31
00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:38.062
It's because I already knew...

32
00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:41.233
that this was the answer.

33
00:02:42.794 --> 00:02:44.294
But...

34
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.150
I asked you to solve a problem
I already know the answer to

35
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.247
and hoped that you would
choose the wrong answer.

36
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:52.693
Because you wouldn't
be able to help it.

37
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:17.695
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

38
00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:20.362
For giving me a serious
and proper rejection, I mean.

39
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.709
Because, that means...

40
00:03:25.354 --> 00:03:28.372
that you took my
confession seriously, too.

41
00:03:29.983 --> 00:03:31.537
Let's go downstairs now.

42
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:48.871
It's coming from the men's
bathroom, Mr. Kang!

43
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.064
Which son-of-a-bitch
was smoking at school?

44
00:04:15.994 --> 00:04:17.365
You're not hurt anywhere, are you?

45
00:04:17.365 --> 00:04:19.329
I should be the one asking you that.

46
00:04:19.882 --> 00:04:21.848
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

47
00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:23.120
Some of the embers
might have singed you

48
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.343
so check yourself over carefully
when you get home.

49
00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.870
We can't go this way.
Let's try the other side.

50
00:04:39.822 --> 00:04:41.177
Ugh.

51
00:04:41.884 --> 00:04:44.858
You have your phone, right?
Give it to me. I'll call someone.

52
00:04:44.858 --> 00:04:47.028
I don't have my cellphone.

53
00:04:47.028 --> 00:04:49.934
What?
Why not?

54
00:04:49.934 --> 00:04:52.540
I usually don't bring my phone to school

55
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.019
since I'll get demerits
if I'm caught with one.

56
00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:55.403
Then...

57
00:04:55.802 --> 00:04:57.105
how are we going to
get out of here now?

58
00:04:57.105 --> 00:05:00.399
I feel like I should be the one
asking you that question.

59
00:05:10.814 --> 00:05:13.420
What the... what's wrong
with the lights?

60
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.785
Oh, they must have short-circuited when
we were putting out the fire earlier.

61
00:05:17.615 --> 00:05:20.591
Ugh, this is driving me crazy!

62
00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:27.595
Ugh.

63
00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:28.923
What floor are we on, again?

64
00:05:28.923 --> 00:05:30.386
The... third floor.

65
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.831
Oh!

66
00:05:35.872 --> 00:05:38.704
This is probably way too high up
to try and jump down, right?

67
00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:42.130
Man, what do we do?

68
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.125
I bet your parents
will be so worried.

69
00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:46.526
Oh, the two of them are away
at a conference.

70
00:05:46.526 --> 00:05:48.526
They'll probably come home
the day after tomorrow.

71
00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:50.572
Oh man.

72
00:05:50.572 --> 00:05:52.879
I bet this is going to hurt
my lower back like crazy.

73
00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.550
Do I have to sleep on
top of the desks, then?

74
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.512
Have you always been
such a reckless person?

75
00:05:57.512 --> 00:05:58.581
Pardon?

76
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:00.463
You're going to get yourself into
tons of trouble one of these days!

77
00:06:00.463 --> 00:06:02.480
Do you know what a scary place
this world is nowadays?

78
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.653
If you get locked in a place
like this with a man

79
00:06:03.653 --> 00:06:05.548
the first thing you should do
is to dig through a tool box!

80
00:06:05.548 --> 00:06:07.653
You should hold a hammer in one
hand, and a club in the other

81
00:06:07.653 --> 00:06:10.220
and stay at least three meters
away from him, all right?

82
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.904
You know, like...

83
00:06:12.887 --> 00:06:15.024
hold onto something like
this, at the very least!

84
00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:16.773
Why... would I need to do that?

85
00:06:17.755 --> 00:06:20.449
Also, I'm not a woman.
I'm your disciple.

86
00:06:22.146 --> 00:06:24.187
At any rate, from now on

87
00:06:24.187 --> 00:06:25.997
if something like this happens
to you again in the future...

88
00:06:25.997 --> 00:06:27.346
wait, no.

89
00:06:27.346 --> 00:06:29.391
Something like this can never
happen to you again.

90
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:30.437
You got that?

91
00:06:30.437 --> 00:06:31.894
Hurry up and answer me!

92
00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:33.923
Yes, Mr. Kang.

93
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.836
Well, we don't have any
other choice today, though

94
00:06:37.836 --> 00:06:39.105
so you sleep here.

95
00:06:39.105 --> 00:06:40.596
I'm going to go sleep in the hallway.

96
00:06:41.516 --> 00:06:42.684
Oh!

97
00:06:42.684 --> 00:06:47.307
Um... you want me to...
sleep in here alone?

98
00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:59.569
Mr. Kang.

99
00:07:00.624 --> 00:07:02.107
Are you sleeping?

100
00:07:04.617 --> 00:07:05.951
No.

101
00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:07.831
Then...

102
00:07:08.904 --> 00:07:12.923
can't you...
tell me about your first love?

103
00:07:17.857 --> 00:07:20.047
She was in the same class
as me in high school.

104
00:07:20.927 --> 00:07:25.120
I liked her quite a lot back then,
and I still like her a lot now.

105
00:07:25.617 --> 00:07:27.774
How does that person
feel about you, then?

106
00:07:27.774 --> 00:07:32.072
Does that person
like you too, Mr. Kang?

107
00:07:34.377 --> 00:07:35.634
Well...

108
00:07:35.634 --> 00:07:39.728
that's a really difficult question
for me to answer.

109
00:07:39.728 --> 00:07:41.735
How should I put this?

110
00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:44.793
Do I say that she used to like me,
or that she likes me?

111
00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:48.278
What's her name?

112
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:50.817
The name of your first love.

113
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.807
That's something that I really
can't tell you right now.

114
00:07:57.528 --> 00:07:58.625
Why not?

115
00:07:59.266 --> 00:08:00.870
Later.

116
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.975
I'll tell you later.

117
00:08:02.975 --> 00:08:05.355
What's her job, then?

118
00:08:05.355 --> 00:08:06.603
She's a doctor.

119
00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.358
Is she pretty?

120
00:08:10.358 --> 00:08:11.646
Yeah.

121
00:08:11.646 --> 00:08:13.060
Really, really pretty.

122
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.221
Why did your first love have to be
someone who was so perfect in every way?

123
00:08:17.221 --> 00:08:19.392
I can't even compete against her.

124
00:08:20.572 --> 00:08:22.468
Well, it's okay.

125
00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:25.548
They say that people never end up
with their first loves, anyway.

126
00:08:26.341 --> 00:08:28.881
So, starting today,
I'm going to pray

127
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:32.417
that your first love
gets married to someone else.

128
00:08:32.417 --> 00:08:35.852
Hey, Han Ji Soo!
That was a bit over the line!

129
00:08:38.563 --> 00:08:39.873
Mr. Kang.

130
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.610
Yeah?

131
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.638
I...

132
00:08:44.567 --> 00:08:47.732
won't make you feel
uncomfortable anymore.

133
00:08:48.725 --> 00:08:51.693
Since I've received a gift for having
my heart properly broken and all.

134
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.715
The gift... for having
your heart broken?

135
00:08:54.715 --> 00:08:58.570
Didn't you have thoughts
like this, too

136
00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.113
When you liked your
first love, Mr. Kang?

137
00:09:01.113 --> 00:09:07.039
Things like, "I wish I could be alone
with that person for just one day."

138
00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:12.724
"I wish we could talk
and laugh together."

139
00:09:14.091 --> 00:09:16.587
If I could just have
one day like that

140
00:09:16.587 --> 00:09:18.681
I wouldn't wish
for anything else.

141
00:09:18.681 --> 00:09:20.216
Thoughts like that.

142
00:09:22.654 --> 00:09:26.370
I just had that wish
come true for me.

143
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.381
So, now...

144
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:33.763
I won't make you feel
uncomfortable anymore.

145
00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.682
Thanks for understanding.

146
00:09:42.673 --> 00:09:46.039
Also, look closely around you.

147
00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:50.559
There's definitely a little punk
who's thinking the same thing you are.

148
00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:53.033
Someone who'd be satisfied with
not a day, but even just half a day.

149
00:09:53.033 --> 00:09:54.600
Wait, no.

150
00:09:54.697 --> 00:09:59.245
Someone who would be satisfied with
being alone with you for even an hour.

151
00:09:59.798 --> 00:10:01.783
Who's that?

152
00:10:03.418 --> 00:10:05.418
<i>Oh, just someone.</i>

153
00:10:06.265 --> 00:10:09.801
<i>A punk who will go on to
like only you...</i>

154
00:10:10.875 --> 00:10:12.254
for the next ten years.

155
00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:25.856
I would've been happy...

156
00:11:27.885 --> 00:11:29.678
if this hadn't happened now...

157
00:11:30.407 --> 00:11:34.302
but at another time,
under different circumstances.

158
00:11:36.272 --> 00:11:37.613
I would have been...

159
00:11:38.815 --> 00:11:41.264
so happy to have been
confessed to by you.

160
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:31.808
What is this?

161
00:12:31.808 --> 00:12:33.216
<i>Kang Shin Woo?</i>

162
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.645
Mr. Kang?

163
00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:39.359
Is that you, Mr. Kang?

164
00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:41.910
<i>Yeah, it's me!
I'm trapped in here!</i>

165
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.344
<i>Hey, do you see something that
looks like a switch there?</i>

166
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.903
Just a moment.

167
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.398
W-what the...

168
00:13:01.398 --> 00:13:03.561
t-there was an emergency exit?

169
00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:04.976
What are you doing here, sir?

170
00:13:04.976 --> 00:13:07.107
I know, right?
Exactly!

171
00:13:08.118 --> 00:13:11.519
Hey, what was I
even doing here?

172
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:14.378
<i>Mr. Kang!</i>

173
00:13:19.604 --> 00:13:21.038
You...

174
00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:24.307
were here together all night?

175
00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.409
With Ji Soo?

176
00:13:32.607 --> 00:13:33.927
No.

177
00:13:34.657 --> 00:13:36.304
I was here alone.

178
00:13:36.304 --> 00:13:39.035
I was here alone all night,
until you got me out.

179
00:13:39.035 --> 00:13:40.096
You...

180
00:13:40.692 --> 00:13:42.830
understand what I'm trying to say,
right, Kang Shin Woo?

181
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.692
Let's get out of here first.

182
00:13:45.692 --> 00:13:47.181
And I need to explain
the situation to you, too.

183
00:13:47.181 --> 00:13:48.352
I have no reason...

184
00:13:48.836 --> 00:13:50.609
to hear your explanation.

185
00:13:51.245 --> 00:13:54.138
You didn't tell me to come here early in
the morning to talk to me about this.

186
00:13:54.138 --> 00:13:55.865
There's no way that those thugs
from our class will come.

187
00:13:56.581 --> 00:13:58.522
So whether you make me volunteer
around school, or punish me...

188
00:13:59.099 --> 00:14:00.706
I'll do what I need to do.

189
00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.970
So you do what you need
to do as well, Mr. Kang.

190
00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:05.438
Because I completely understand...

191
00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:07.927
what you're trying to say.

192
00:14:21.052 --> 00:14:22.365
Shin Woo!

193
00:14:26.485 --> 00:14:29.046
Were you the one who
opened the door for us?

194
00:14:47.884 --> 00:14:49.730
Eat even if you don't
have an appetite.

195
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.217
You didn't even sleep well

196
00:14:51.217 --> 00:14:54.024
so you'll have to eat well if you're
going to get through the day.

197
00:14:54.024 --> 00:14:55.315
Yes, Mr. Kang.

198
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:07.910
But, why did Shin Woo fight
with Go Sung Jin yesterday?

199
00:15:08.384 --> 00:15:09.384
Huh?

200
00:15:09.384 --> 00:15:12.068
His face looked really badly injured.

201
00:15:17.576 --> 00:15:19.335
Just a moment, Mr. Kang.

202
00:15:27.504 --> 00:15:29.927
<i>[Jisan Pharmacy]</i>

203
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.183
Here.

204
00:15:42.826 --> 00:15:43.937
What's this?

205
00:15:43.937 --> 00:15:45.840
Ointment, what else?

206
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.880
It's fine.

207
00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:51.070
It'll scar if you don't treat it.

208
00:15:55.495 --> 00:15:57.941
I got rejected last night.

209
00:15:58.543 --> 00:15:59.813
And all night, at that.

210
00:16:00.374 --> 00:16:03.294
And I couldn't even run away after
I got rejected since we were locked in.

211
00:16:03.294 --> 00:16:04.294
Hey.

212
00:16:04.294 --> 00:16:06.232
Don't go around saying
things like that to anyone.

213
00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:08.533
Who else would I talk about
this with, except you?

214
00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:09.869
I'm saying, be careful!

215
00:16:10.417 --> 00:16:13.634
For you, that may have just been a night
when you were rejected by Mr. Kang.

216
00:16:14.149 --> 00:16:16.419
But others might believe
that it wasn't just that.

217
00:16:16.419 --> 00:16:17.988
What do you mean...

218
00:16:17.988 --> 00:16:21.597
A male teacher and a
female student who liked him

219
00:16:21.597 --> 00:16:23.811
spent the night at school together.

220
00:16:23.811 --> 00:16:26.923
Who do you think will be hurt
if that rumor spreads?

221
00:16:30.298 --> 00:16:32.073
Hey, Kang Shin Woo!

222
00:16:35.197 --> 00:16:38.812
You know that it wasn't like that at all!

223
00:16:38.812 --> 00:16:40.642
So what if I know?

224
00:16:41.205 --> 00:16:42.697
What does that matter?

225
00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:49.898
<i>Which crazy bastard did this?</i>

226
00:16:49.898 --> 00:16:52.908
Not only did you smoke in school,
but you started a fire, too?

227
00:16:52.908 --> 00:16:55.054
Why didn't you just burn the
school down, while you were at it?

228
00:16:55.054 --> 00:16:56.216
Huh?

229
00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:57.692
Who was it?

230
00:16:57.692 --> 00:16:59.213
You're not going to confess?

231
00:16:59.213 --> 00:17:00.884
Don't, then.
Don't.

232
00:17:00.884 --> 00:17:02.903
I'm going to get a full-on
forensic investigation done!

233
00:17:02.903 --> 00:17:03.943
Got that?

234
00:17:03.943 --> 00:17:04.960
Get up.

235
00:17:07.337 --> 00:17:08.695
Heed my words, Culprit.

236
00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:10.007
You only have until today.

237
00:17:10.007 --> 00:17:12.127
If you don't confess
that it was you by today

238
00:17:12.127 --> 00:17:13.846
this won't just end with just
a letter of apology.

239
00:17:13.846 --> 00:17:14.948
Got that?

240
00:17:14.948 --> 00:17:16.845
This will end with a
police report instead!

241
00:17:23.163 --> 00:17:25.117
Damn, who on earth was it?

242
00:17:25.744 --> 00:17:26.934
Hey, Kang Shin Woo!

243
00:17:28.085 --> 00:17:29.643
See me for a sec.

244
00:17:32.997 --> 00:17:35.538
What did you want to talk about?

245
00:17:35.538 --> 00:17:36.824
It was me.

246
00:17:36.824 --> 00:17:39.028
The one who smoked in the
bathroom yesterday, I mean.

247
00:17:39.028 --> 00:17:41.854
Of course, I didn't start
that fire on purpose.

248
00:17:41.854 --> 00:17:44.414
I just tossed my cigarette
butt out, but...

249
00:17:45.006 --> 00:17:46.915
I got unlucky,
and this ended up happening.

250
00:17:46.915 --> 00:17:49.510
Why not go to Mokzart with this
pathetic confession instead?

251
00:17:50.291 --> 00:17:51.858
I bet the dean will love it.

252
00:17:51.858 --> 00:17:52.953
I'm afraid that

253
00:17:52.953 --> 00:17:55.442
you'll have to be the one
to do the confessing, though.

254
00:17:55.442 --> 00:17:56.842
And say that you were the culprit.

255
00:17:56.842 --> 00:17:59.349
Oh no, what a shame, though.

256
00:17:59.349 --> 00:18:02.076
I really don't have the time to
listen to your bullshit.

257
00:18:02.076 --> 00:18:05.415
If you're bored, go and do
what you're good at.

258
00:18:05.415 --> 00:18:07.348
You know, sleeping.

259
00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:09.013
Oh, really, now?

260
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:11.893
I wonder if you could still
say that after seeing this.

261
00:18:14.397 --> 00:18:16.925
You like Han Ji Soo, right?

262
00:18:24.442 --> 00:18:26.490
Hey, Kang Shin Woo!
Where are you going?

263
00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.084
Why are you going to the main office?

264
00:18:30.715 --> 00:18:31.765
Jeez.

265
00:18:31.765 --> 00:18:33.965
What's gotten into
that punk these days?

266
00:18:33.965 --> 00:18:37.554
So they want me to do a forensic
investigation, then. Fine.

267
00:18:37.554 --> 00:18:39.352
Yeah, what is it, Kang Shin Woo?

268
00:18:41.048 --> 00:18:42.775
Are you out of your mind, you bastard?

269
00:18:42.775 --> 00:18:44.901
It was me.

270
00:18:44.901 --> 00:18:45.989
What are you talking about?

271
00:18:45.989 --> 00:18:48.349
The one who smoked in the
bathroom and started the fire...

272
00:18:49.143 --> 00:18:50.238
was me.

273
00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:55.547
Hey!

274
00:18:55.547 --> 00:18:57.690
That crazy bastard Kang Shin Woo
really has lost his mind!

275
00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.115
Why?
What happened?

276
00:18:59.115 --> 00:19:01.175
You know the fire in the bathroom?

277
00:19:01.175 --> 00:19:02.279
Apparently, the one who
smoked was Shin Woo!

278
00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:04.567
What are you talking about?
Shin Woo doesn't smoke.

279
00:19:04.567 --> 00:19:05.615
That's what I'm saying.

280
00:19:05.615 --> 00:19:08.836
But he went to Mokzart
and turned himself in!

281
00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:11.036
Where is Kang Shin Woo right now?

282
00:19:11.036 --> 00:19:12.726
Um, the main office.

283
00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:14.258
Fourteen!

284
00:19:15.183 --> 00:19:16.387
Fifteen!

285
00:19:16.877 --> 00:19:17.929
Jeez.

286
00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:19.250
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

287
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.335
I didn't know this, but he's actually
quite a troublemaker.

288
00:19:22.335 --> 00:19:24.316
What? You dare glare at me
as you confess that you did it?

289
00:19:24.316 --> 00:19:26.067
That's arson, you bastard!

290
00:19:26.067 --> 00:19:28.573
Arson is the next most serious
crime, after murder!

291
00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:31.603
Sixteen.

292
00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:33.413
Get up, Kang Shin Woo.

293
00:19:33.413 --> 00:19:34.424
Mr. Kang.

294
00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:36.509
This isn't an issue that you can
just resolve in your classroom.

295
00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:37.541
All right?

296
00:19:39.105 --> 00:19:40.468
Try smoking this.

297
00:19:41.317 --> 00:19:42.628
Why are you just lying there?

298
00:19:42.628 --> 00:19:46.525
If you really are the culprit, then smoke
these in front of me, you bastard!

299
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:57.209
M-mom.

300
00:20:00.797 --> 00:20:03.008
Is it true, sir?

301
00:20:03.875 --> 00:20:06.147
Did my Shin Woo really...

302
00:20:06.147 --> 00:20:08.005
smoke a cigarette in school...

303
00:20:08.005 --> 00:20:09.945
and start a fire?

304
00:20:10.491 --> 00:20:11.509
Yes.

305
00:20:13.148 --> 00:20:14.560
Is it true?

306
00:20:15.261 --> 00:20:16.663
Did you really do it?

307
00:20:16.663 --> 00:20:17.809
Yeah.

308
00:20:18.429 --> 00:20:19.558
I did it.

309
00:20:19.558 --> 00:20:21.045
How could you have done it?

310
00:20:21.871 --> 00:20:24.109
How could you have done that?

311
00:20:28.037 --> 00:20:29.547
Please don't do this, ma'am.

312
00:20:30.423 --> 00:20:32.749
This will only hurt you more.

313
00:20:37.681 --> 00:20:39.164
Don't you remember
how your father died?

314
00:20:39.164 --> 00:20:41.221
Did I raise you to be like that?

315
00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:42.827
Did I work tirelessly for
365 days a year

316
00:20:42.827 --> 00:20:46.567
just so you could do things
like this, you bastard?

317
00:20:46.567 --> 00:20:48.933
Please calm down, ma'am, okay?

318
00:20:49.467 --> 00:20:50.846
Please don't do this, ma'am.

319
00:20:51.502 --> 00:20:53.057
It wasn't Shin Woo.

320
00:20:53.057 --> 00:20:54.436
I know this for certain.

321
00:20:55.035 --> 00:20:57.316
Shin Woo definitely isn't
the one who did this.

322
00:20:57.316 --> 00:20:59.431
My Shin Woo didn't do it, Mr. Kang?

323
00:20:59.431 --> 00:21:01.519
So don't act this way here...

324
00:21:02.257 --> 00:21:03.851
and go back home, ma'am.

325
00:21:03.851 --> 00:21:05.607
Everything will be fine.

326
00:21:05.607 --> 00:21:08.484
Who did it, then, if it wasn't
Kang Shin Woo? Huh?

327
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:12.762
That makes no sense.

328
00:21:20.032 --> 00:21:22.305
How... do you know, Mr. Kang?

329
00:21:22.305 --> 00:21:23.892
You really are...

330
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.375
hopeless.

331
00:21:27.313 --> 00:21:28.400
I was hoping

332
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.493
that you'd choose differently,
this time around.

333
00:21:31.182 --> 00:21:32.267
You...

334
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.404
like Han Ji Soo, right?

335
00:21:35.372 --> 00:21:37.876
Want me to give this to
Han Ji Soo instead?

336
00:21:37.876 --> 00:21:41.143
Or, would you rather go
to the dean for me?

337
00:21:50.624 --> 00:21:54.011
<i>My eighteen-year-old self
was that much of a coward.</i>

338
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.308
<i>I didn't have the courage
to reveal my feelings to Ji Soo.</i>

339
00:21:58.308 --> 00:22:02.180
<i>I was so much of a coward that I took
the blame for those thugs' wrongdoing.</i>

340
00:22:05.394 --> 00:22:09.342
Don't you even remember
how your father died?

341
00:22:13.686 --> 00:22:15.509
<I>But, I didn't know back then...</I>

342
00:22:18.449 --> 00:22:19.865
<i>That I didn't have
long after that...</i>

343
00:22:20.364 --> 00:22:22.178
<i>until both my mom
and Ji Soo...</i>

344
00:22:23.215 --> 00:22:25.464
<i>would leave my side.</i>

345
00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:27.625
Mom.

346
00:22:28.526 --> 00:22:31.045
I didn't know that would be
the last time I'd see you.

347
00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:33.010
Who am I...

348
00:22:33.714 --> 00:22:35.548
supposed to...

349
00:22:37.865 --> 00:22:39.635
apologize to...

350
00:22:43.103 --> 00:22:45.159
now?

351
00:22:46.693 --> 00:22:47.693
<i>I...</i>

352
00:22:48.196 --> 00:22:51.525
<i>You're not hiding your feelings
because you like Ji Soo.</i>

353
00:22:51.525 --> 00:22:54.627
It was just that being cowardly
was easier for you

354
00:22:54.627 --> 00:22:56.071
while hiding behind me.

355
00:22:57.118 --> 00:22:59.407
I was hoping that you wouldn't
be cowardly this time.

356
00:22:59.407 --> 00:23:02.840
I was hoping you'd be a
better person, but you...

357
00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:05.431
are completely twisted.

358
00:23:12.455 --> 00:23:17.455
<font color="E06287">[DramaFever Ver] E03 Longing Heart</font>
<font color="#7474C1">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

359
00:23:23.137 --> 00:23:24.782
I'm not cutting class.

360
00:23:24.782 --> 00:23:26.563
You told me to volunteer around school.

361
00:23:27.066 --> 00:23:28.917
You didn't specify where I needed to be.

362
00:23:29.521 --> 00:23:32.569
But I have to obey
every word you say.

363
00:23:32.569 --> 00:23:35.286
Then listen the hell up,
instead of spouting nonsense.

364
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.960
Because I know that it was you.

365
00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:43.178
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

366
00:23:43.178 --> 00:23:47.099
You were the one who smoked in
the bathroom yesterday.

367
00:23:47.099 --> 00:23:50.275
You picked up the gift that Kang Shin Woo
threw away in the dumpster

368
00:23:50.275 --> 00:23:52.336
and I'm sure you used that
to blackmail Kang Shin Woo.

369
00:23:52.336 --> 00:23:53.479
Oh, I'm sorry.

370
00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:56.035
I can't give you a 100 for that answer.

371
00:23:56.471 --> 00:23:57.568
What?

372
00:23:57.568 --> 00:24:00.412
It's true that I did pick up the
gift that Kang Shin Woo threw away

373
00:24:00.412 --> 00:24:03.298
but I never blackmailed him with it.

374
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.204
This is 911, right?

375
00:24:12.204 --> 00:24:14.230
I have something to ask you.

376
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.248
Hey.

377
00:24:15.248 --> 00:24:17.240
What if it really was
Kang Shin Woo who did that?

378
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.874
He'll probably just be given
disciplinary action, right?

379
00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:22.148
But this isn't just a simple smoking
incident that he was busted for.

380
00:24:22.148 --> 00:24:23.299
They said it was arson.

381
00:24:23.299 --> 00:24:25.623
It's not arson if it wasn't intentional.
It'll be considered an accident.

382
00:24:25.623 --> 00:24:28.035
The correct terminology
isn't the important thing, here!

383
00:24:28.035 --> 00:24:29.508
Of course it is, when it determines
how severe a crime is!

384
00:24:29.508 --> 00:24:31.602
Arson is deliberate,
while an accident is not!

385
00:24:31.602 --> 00:24:33.660
Do you think I want to hear
an explanation about that right now?

386
00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.247
Stop it, already!

387
00:24:35.247 --> 00:24:37.506
Not even my mom and dad
fight like you two do!

388
00:24:37.506 --> 00:24:39.863
You two are even worse than a couple
that has been married for 20 years!

389
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:41.490
Ugh.

390
00:24:45.537 --> 00:24:47.119
Where are you going, Ji Soo?

391
00:24:47.983 --> 00:24:50.970
Why is Kang Shin Woo
doing this, then?

392
00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:54.856
I'm sure Kang Shin Woo knows
the answer, so go ask him.

393
00:24:55.898 --> 00:25:00.099
I have to go now to get suspended
or expelled, or whatever else.

394
00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:01.953
Stop putting on that
tough guy act, punk.

395
00:25:03.519 --> 00:25:05.076
You think that

396
00:25:05.076 --> 00:25:07.585
there will come a day when
you will get the chance

397
00:25:07.585 --> 00:25:10.092
to right all of the wrongs
you're committing now, right?

398
00:25:10.664 --> 00:25:12.643
But people don't know that

399
00:25:12.643 --> 00:25:17.339
those kinds of chances in the future
aren't fairly distributed to everyone.

400
00:25:18.304 --> 00:25:19.988
And that, what you can change

401
00:25:19.988 --> 00:25:22.385
isn't the future,
but only the here and now.

402
00:25:22.385 --> 00:25:24.395
The reason why I came here

403
00:25:24.395 --> 00:25:27.203
isn't just because of Kang Shin Woo,
but because of you, too.

404
00:25:29.272 --> 00:25:30.704
It's so that you can listen to

405
00:25:30.704 --> 00:25:34.946
what you'll be doing on what month,
date, hour, and minute.

406
00:25:36.037 --> 00:25:37.423
So that you can listen carefully
to what will happen to you...

407
00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:40.141
so that you might start living
your life better from now on.

408
00:25:40.727 --> 00:25:43.179
So go, and confess it yourself.

409
00:25:43.179 --> 00:25:46.136
Tell me why Kang Shin Woo
is doing that at the main office.

410
00:25:51.309 --> 00:25:54.507
So you're saying that you did it, right?

411
00:25:54.507 --> 00:25:55.678
Yes.

412
00:25:55.678 --> 00:25:57.313
You're saying that you did it

413
00:25:57.313 --> 00:25:59.320
but Mr. Kang keeps insisting
that it wasn't you.

414
00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.493
This is driving me insane.

415
00:26:00.493 --> 00:26:02.355
How am I supposed to make
heads or tails of this?

416
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.838
Sir.

417
00:26:07.007 --> 00:26:09.790
Shin Woo wasn't the one
who smoked yesterday.

418
00:26:10.496 --> 00:26:11.674
What are you talking about?

419
00:26:11.674 --> 00:26:13.567
Yeah, what are you talking about,
seriously? Tell me.

420
00:26:13.567 --> 00:26:16.140
I saw Shin Woo on his way
out of school yesterday.

421
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.846
And I remember the exact time, too

422
00:26:17.846 --> 00:26:19.788
since I'd locked up the library
and left at that time.

423
00:26:19.788 --> 00:26:22.036
But there's too huge of a gap between
the time that Shin Woo left school

424
00:26:22.036 --> 00:26:24.798
and when the fire alarm went off.

425
00:26:24.798 --> 00:26:26.242
I asked the fire department

426
00:26:26.242 --> 00:26:29.086
and the time it usually takes for a
cigarette butt to start a fire

427
00:26:29.086 --> 00:26:30.498
is 12 minutes, but...

428
00:26:30.498 --> 00:26:31.748
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

429
00:26:31.748 --> 00:26:33.848
How do you know what time
the fire alarm went off?

430
00:26:33.848 --> 00:26:36.226
Mr. Kang was the only person
at school when it went off!

431
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.022
Well...

432
00:26:42.766 --> 00:26:44.048
Hey, Han Ji Soo.

433
00:26:45.535 --> 00:26:46.935
Last night...

434
00:26:46.935 --> 00:26:50.132
Mr. Kang and I were locked behind
the fireproof gates together...

435
00:26:50.132 --> 00:26:53.488
If we'd been locked in there together,
I would've been a lot less bored.

436
00:26:54.203 --> 00:26:55.353
Right?

437
00:26:56.492 --> 00:26:58.734
When I was going around
looking for witnesses

438
00:26:58.734 --> 00:27:00.535
I told people what time
the fire alarm went off.

439
00:27:01.105 --> 00:27:03.603
Thanks, Sherlock Holmes.
You're right.

440
00:27:03.603 --> 00:27:05.188
It wasn't Kang Shin Woo.

441
00:27:05.188 --> 00:27:06.285
What's this, then?

442
00:27:06.285 --> 00:27:08.305
Oh, I know. A ghost must
have smoked it.

443
00:27:08.305 --> 00:27:10.093
Right?
Sheesh.

444
00:27:10.093 --> 00:27:11.132
Oh, never mind.

445
00:27:11.132 --> 00:27:13.876
It doesn't matter, since we'll have
our culprit after we get the DNA tested...

446
00:27:13.876 --> 00:27:15.036
Wait, wait, wait!

447
00:27:15.036 --> 00:27:16.068
What is it?

448
00:27:16.068 --> 00:27:17.884
Wow.

449
00:27:18.596 --> 00:27:19.767
Look at this.

450
00:27:21.778 --> 00:27:25.156
He smoked it right down to the filter.

451
00:27:25.156 --> 00:27:26.316
Those bastards.

452
00:27:26.316 --> 00:27:28.368
Oh no!
Oh no!

453
00:27:28.368 --> 00:27:29.430
Mr. Kang!

454
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.618
Oh my!

455
00:27:31.785 --> 00:27:33.311
Oh my.

456
00:27:33.311 --> 00:27:36.273
I don't know if you'll still be able
to do DNA testing with this!

457
00:27:36.273 --> 00:27:38.087
I don't think you'll be able to.

458
00:27:39.413 --> 00:27:41.367
And just how long will
you be cutting class?

459
00:27:41.367 --> 00:27:43.037
Hurry up and go to the classroom!

460
00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:48.813
How could you be so careless?

461
00:27:48.813 --> 00:27:49.863
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:49.863 --> 00:27:50.980
Fix this, now!

463
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:59.202
I can go on my own.

464
00:27:59.796 --> 00:28:01.121
Oh, really, now?

465
00:28:01.121 --> 00:28:02.251
Ow!

466
00:28:02.251 --> 00:28:03.913
You're unbelievable.

467
00:28:03.913 --> 00:28:05.965
Why on earth did you do this?

468
00:28:05.965 --> 00:28:10.073
Why did you go so far as to get beaten
like this, and lie about doing that?

469
00:28:11.707 --> 00:28:14.286
You like Han Ji Soo, don't you?

470
00:28:15.044 --> 00:28:16.330
Yeah.

471
00:28:17.144 --> 00:28:18.545
I like her.

472
00:28:19.234 --> 00:28:20.701
What are you going to do about it?

473
00:28:20.701 --> 00:28:21.990
No, I'm just saying...

474
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.534
that I was at the stairwell
early this morning, too.

475
00:28:24.534 --> 00:28:26.886
A male teacher who is
in the prime of his youth

476
00:28:26.886 --> 00:28:28.700
and a young female student

477
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.652
spent the night together.

478
00:28:30.652 --> 00:28:32.670
Even though there was
an emergency exit door.

479
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:36.409
Wow, I bet this story will get
people's imaginations going.

480
00:28:37.018 --> 00:28:39.481
And this happened at
school, of all places.

481
00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:40.490
You crazy bastard!

482
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:41.638
Hey.

483
00:28:43.583 --> 00:28:44.871
So, what will you do?

484
00:28:44.871 --> 00:28:47.238
Shall I use my imagination
to fill in the blanks about

485
00:28:47.238 --> 00:28:49.646
what happened between Mr. Kang
and Han Ji Soo by myself?

486
00:28:49.646 --> 00:28:52.890
Or should I make the rest of the school
join me in filling in the blanks?

487
00:28:55.194 --> 00:28:56.808
That's why I'm saying...

488
00:28:59.638 --> 00:29:01.366
<i>you need to do me this favor.</i>

489
00:29:01.903 --> 00:29:02.917
Huh?

490
00:29:02.917 --> 00:29:04.835
- I asked you why you did it?
- Oh.

491
00:29:06.355 --> 00:29:08.253
I had my reasons.

492
00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:12.240
It would've been better for me
to have gotten hit and be done with it.

493
00:29:12.868 --> 00:29:14.310
- Ow!
- Oh!

494
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:15.368
Are you okay?

495
00:29:15.796 --> 00:29:17.414
See?

496
00:29:22.164 --> 00:29:25.215
<i>I was so frustrated at the fact
that the past wasn't changing</i>

497
00:29:25.215 --> 00:29:28.815
<i>despite how hard
I was trying to change it.</i>

498
00:29:29.416 --> 00:29:30.563
<i>But...</i>

499
00:29:31.059 --> 00:29:35.096
<i>something that changed
without me realizing it...</i>

500
00:29:35.096 --> 00:29:36.763
<i>was him.</i>

501
00:29:37.277 --> 00:29:40.092
What about you?
Why did you do that?

502
00:29:40.921 --> 00:29:42.017
What?

503
00:29:43.695 --> 00:29:48.357
You were going to tell Mokzart that
you were at school yesterday too, right?

504
00:29:48.778 --> 00:29:50.354
I told you.

505
00:29:50.354 --> 00:29:52.471
No good will come out of
people knowing about it.

506
00:29:52.471 --> 00:29:54.294
Who cares if people find out?

507
00:29:54.294 --> 00:29:56.439
How could I just watch
as this happened to you?

508
00:29:59.147 --> 00:30:01.273
I'm thinking about reporting this
to the Department of Education.

509
00:30:01.273 --> 00:30:04.522
Is it okay for them to beat someone
like this, without checking the facts?

510
00:30:05.193 --> 00:30:10.801
We can report that together
and then just quit school, too.

511
00:30:11.938 --> 00:30:14.067
It's just that this makes me so upset!

512
00:30:18.826 --> 00:30:20.583
<i>But, why did Shin Woo...</i>

513
00:30:20.583 --> 00:30:23.057
get into a fight with
Go Sung Jin yesterday?

514
00:30:24.772 --> 00:30:27.298
His face looked really
badly injured.

515
00:30:28.299 --> 00:30:30.323
Just a moment, Mr. Kang.

516
00:30:34.066 --> 00:30:36.709
<i>One of them is unaware of
other people's feelings...</i>

517
00:30:37.259 --> 00:30:39.326
<i>and the other one is unaware of
their own feelings.</i>

518
00:30:55.657 --> 00:30:58.442
<i>[Letter of Resignation]</i>

519
00:31:01.634 --> 00:31:03.867
You submitted a letter of resignation?

520
00:31:03.867 --> 00:31:05.676
Did something happen?

521
00:31:05.676 --> 00:31:09.280
I just feel like I don't need to
be here anymore, is all.

522
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.752
There's no class that doesn't
need its homeroom teacher.

523
00:31:11.752 --> 00:31:13.470
So, I'm sorry, but...

524
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:17.279
I'll leave my class to you
until vacation.

525
00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:20.726
Why are you talking like that
as if I'll never see you again?

526
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.574
You'll keep seeing me around
until you get sick of me

527
00:31:27.574 --> 00:31:29.770
so don't you worry about that.

528
00:31:36.351 --> 00:31:38.470
What would you call this?

529
00:31:39.308 --> 00:31:43.077
The background and the
subject don't quite match.

530
00:31:44.305 --> 00:31:45.624
Disharmony?

531
00:31:47.624 --> 00:31:49.481
Why is he here?

532
00:31:55.694 --> 00:31:57.182
Jeez.

533
00:31:57.182 --> 00:32:01.470
Our homeroom teacher definitely
said that he graduated from our school.

534
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:02.710
Ugh.

535
00:32:03.584 --> 00:32:07.180
I was planning to find embarrassing
photos of him and show them to Ms. Baek.

536
00:32:08.711 --> 00:32:09.811
Wait a minute.

537
00:32:10.363 --> 00:32:11.403
Why am I doing this?

538
00:32:11.958 --> 00:32:15.362
Why do I care if Ms. Baek likes Mr. Kang,
or that she can't forget about him?

539
00:32:15.362 --> 00:32:16.932
What does that have to do with me?

540
00:32:24.483 --> 00:32:26.382
What are you doing?
Why aren't you eating?

541
00:32:26.382 --> 00:32:27.651
Oh, um, yeah.
I'm eating.

542
00:32:27.651 --> 00:32:29.319
Let's eat, let's eat.

543
00:32:32.519 --> 00:32:35.173
All right, then!
Eat up, everyone.

544
00:32:35.673 --> 00:32:37.551
Ugh, he has no self-awareness.

545
00:32:37.551 --> 00:32:39.893
Does he want me to eat,
or get indigestion?

546
00:32:40.914 --> 00:32:42.141
Oh yeah.

547
00:32:42.141 --> 00:32:45.069
Oh yeah, where did Kang Shin Woo
and Han Ji Soo go?

548
00:32:45.069 --> 00:32:47.213
They said they were eating ramen,
and went to the school store.

549
00:32:47.213 --> 00:32:48.912
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

550
00:32:48.912 --> 00:32:52.934
But, hey, doesn't it seem like
they've been hanging out together a lot?

551
00:32:52.934 --> 00:32:55.443
Yeah, you're right.
Something fishy is going on between them.

552
00:32:55.443 --> 00:32:56.961
I don't know.

553
00:32:57.531 --> 00:32:59.932
I think you two are the ones
who have something fishy going on.

554
00:32:59.932 --> 00:33:02.080
You two are dating, right?

555
00:33:05.718 --> 00:33:06.757
What?

556
00:33:06.757 --> 00:33:07.953
Who's dating who, now?

557
00:33:07.953 --> 00:33:09.449
H-how did you know, sir?

558
00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:12.040
Because I remember it
starting around this time.

559
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.791
Oh, who cares if you two are dating?

560
00:33:15.791 --> 00:33:19.451
Hey, your homeroom teacher isn't the
type to break couples apart, okay?

561
00:33:20.147 --> 00:33:21.570
I can't accept this.

562
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:25.242
How is this different from me and
Min Seok or me and Shin Woo dating?

563
00:33:25.242 --> 00:33:26.615
Shut your mouth.

564
00:33:26.615 --> 00:33:27.813
Why, I ought to...

565
00:33:30.556 --> 00:33:32.612
I have two friends who
are a couple now.

566
00:33:32.612 --> 00:33:35.388
And they started dating in
high school, just like you two.

567
00:33:35.388 --> 00:33:39.769
But those two ended up
having a kid in college.

568
00:33:40.398 --> 00:33:44.663
Well, they did get married and
live happily with each other, yeah.

569
00:33:44.663 --> 00:33:48.176
But they had to give up
so much because of that.

570
00:33:48.849 --> 00:33:50.007
Their dreams.

571
00:33:50.007 --> 00:33:51.196
Their youth.

572
00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:52.281
Things like that.

573
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:55.239
But, um, why are you telling us
about your friends, Mr. Kang?

574
00:33:55.239 --> 00:33:58.296
Just pay close attention
during sex-ed, okay?

575
00:34:00.186 --> 00:34:01.266
Jeez.

576
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.347
You two are making me lose my appetite.

577
00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:10.697
This is making me feel sick.

578
00:34:10.697 --> 00:34:12.355
Oh yeah, also...

579
00:34:12.355 --> 00:34:14.701
I have a favor to ask of you,
Choo Geun Deok.

580
00:34:15.306 --> 00:34:16.952
Stop Mokzart from making moves.

581
00:34:16.952 --> 00:34:17.998
Pardon?

582
00:34:17.998 --> 00:34:21.809
Stop Mokzart from making
moves on Ms. Baek.

583
00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:23.338
You're an expert at that, after all.

584
00:34:23.338 --> 00:34:26.153
Mokzart likes the English teacher?

585
00:34:26.153 --> 00:34:27.592
Damn it!

586
00:34:32.407 --> 00:34:35.976
All right, your homeroom teacher who has
no self-awareness will disappear now

587
00:34:35.976 --> 00:34:37.405
so enjoy your lunches.

588
00:34:37.405 --> 00:34:38.548
Oh yeah.

589
00:34:39.146 --> 00:34:41.702
Also, if you two get into a fight,
resolve it among yourselves!

590
00:34:41.702 --> 00:34:45.378
Don't call your friends and harass them
about it, especially Kang Shin Woo!

591
00:34:45.378 --> 00:34:46.898
Got that?

592
00:34:48.235 --> 00:34:49.483
Enjoy your lunches.

593
00:34:53.951 --> 00:34:56.315
But... how did Mr. Kang know?

594
00:34:56.315 --> 00:34:57.429
I know, right?

595
00:34:57.429 --> 00:35:01.173
It hasn't even been 24 hours since
we started dating, after all.

596
00:35:04.007 --> 00:35:05.407
Eat up.

597
00:35:06.431 --> 00:35:07.657
You too.

598
00:35:09.115 --> 00:35:11.485
Because your homeroom teacher
destroyed the evidence

599
00:35:11.485 --> 00:35:14.557
we've decided to resolve this matter
within the school, lucky for you.

600
00:35:14.557 --> 00:35:15.650
Got it?

601
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.483
But how dare you lie about doing it!

602
00:35:18.043 --> 00:35:19.795
That's a punishable offense, too, punk!

603
00:35:20.471 --> 00:35:23.184
Be thankful that this is the
extent of your punishment.

604
00:35:23.184 --> 00:35:24.221
Yes, sir.

605
00:35:26.277 --> 00:35:28.021
Both the student and
the teacher are the same.

606
00:35:28.702 --> 00:35:32.128
Not only are they both annoying,
but they also have the same name!

607
00:35:44.237 --> 00:35:46.563
Hey, want to play a game with me?

608
00:35:46.563 --> 00:35:49.137
Didn't you see me getting
hit with a bat before?

609
00:35:49.137 --> 00:35:51.201
I feel like I should be in a
wheelchair right now!

610
00:35:51.201 --> 00:35:54.114
Shouldn't you bounce back from
something like that in half a day?

611
00:35:54.114 --> 00:35:56.206
I feel like I did,
back when I was your age.

612
00:35:57.206 --> 00:35:59.025
Well, unfortunately, I'm not you.

613
00:35:59.884 --> 00:36:01.092
So I'll have to decline.

614
00:36:01.666 --> 00:36:04.916
Well, I decline your declining me
and I'll give you a chance to reconsider.

615
00:36:06.059 --> 00:36:07.266
Because after today

616
00:36:07.266 --> 00:36:09.824
you and I will never be able
to face off against each other again.

617
00:36:13.043 --> 00:36:14.172
Let's go!

618
00:36:15.556 --> 00:36:16.876
"Let's go?"

619
00:36:16.876 --> 00:36:18.436
I have to pump air
into these, though!

620
00:36:20.244 --> 00:36:21.550
- Ow!
- There we go!

621
00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.306
Yay, I scored!

622
00:36:25.306 --> 00:36:27.489
That one doesn't count!
I mean it!

623
00:36:27.489 --> 00:36:29.597
You hit me where I got hit
on purpose just now!

624
00:36:29.597 --> 00:36:31.552
Hey, in that case,
you should be disqualified!

625
00:36:31.552 --> 00:36:33.188
You tripped me and
pinched me last time!

626
00:36:33.188 --> 00:36:37.697
Well, I saw you clenching your teeth
when you elbowed the ball!

627
00:36:37.697 --> 00:36:39.177
Oh... you saw that?

628
00:36:39.177 --> 00:36:41.893
What do you mean... oh, forget it!
I'm not doing this!

629
00:36:41.893 --> 00:36:44.014
I really can't get along with you.

630
00:36:44.014 --> 00:36:46.451
Hey, I was just thinking
the same thing, okay?

631
00:36:59.936 --> 00:37:01.471
Hey, Kang Shin Woo.

632
00:37:03.427 --> 00:37:04.742
Why did you do it?

633
00:37:04.742 --> 00:37:05.922
What do you mean?

634
00:37:05.922 --> 00:37:07.692
Taking the blame for that
thug's smoking incident.

635
00:37:07.692 --> 00:37:08.887
Mr. Kang.

636
00:37:08.887 --> 00:37:10.420
You even knew that the
culprit was that thug?

637
00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.603
Hey, I'm the one who
asked a question.

638
00:37:11.603 --> 00:37:13.791
So don't try to turn this around,
and just answer my question.

639
00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:15.257
Why did you do it?

640
00:37:15.257 --> 00:37:17.300
Why did you say that you did it?

641
00:37:18.746 --> 00:37:19.907
I felt that I had to do that...

642
00:37:20.376 --> 00:37:22.161
in order to not have any regrets.

643
00:37:24.135 --> 00:37:27.766
You're always talking about how you
have regrets and such, Mr. Kang.

644
00:37:28.244 --> 00:37:29.469
So maybe that kind of
thinking rubbed off on me.

645
00:37:30.137 --> 00:37:31.789
I just remembered you
saying that, so...

646
00:37:35.434 --> 00:37:39.259
You know, you're much more
decent of a guy than I am.

647
00:37:43.161 --> 00:37:47.266
You must feel proud that you have
a disciple who has surpassed you.

648
00:37:47.266 --> 00:37:48.971
Eh? Look at you,
messing around with me!

649
00:37:48.971 --> 00:37:50.733
Ow! All right, all right!

650
00:37:52.833 --> 00:37:54.858
But, are you going somewhere, Mr. Kang?

651
00:37:59.106 --> 00:38:00.971
I quit my job at the school today.

652
00:38:00.971 --> 00:38:03.715
And Ms. Baek will be taking over
our class starting tomorrow.

653
00:38:04.489 --> 00:38:05.496
What?

654
00:38:05.496 --> 00:38:07.817
Why? Do you feel like you've finally
gotten a sore tooth extracted?

655
00:38:07.817 --> 00:38:10.152
Wait, so you're not coming
starting tomorrow?

656
00:38:10.152 --> 00:38:11.271
Yeah, you punk!

657
00:38:11.271 --> 00:38:13.802
I, the person who gets in the way, will
disappear just as you wanted me to!

658
00:38:13.802 --> 00:38:14.911
Then...

659
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.679
what about Ji Soo?

660
00:38:17.585 --> 00:38:20.603
Shouldn't you go see her
before you go, at least?

661
00:38:25.393 --> 00:38:27.094
Are you an idiot?
Seriously!

662
00:38:27.094 --> 00:38:28.733
Ji Soo is the girl you like

663
00:38:28.733 --> 00:38:30.543
and I'm the guy that she likes!

664
00:38:30.543 --> 00:38:32.420
And yet, you're telling
me to go see her?

665
00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.893
How could you possibly
say something like that?

666
00:38:33.893 --> 00:38:35.655
- But, still...
- Try one more time.

667
00:38:37.427 --> 00:38:38.431
Here.

668
00:38:39.985 --> 00:38:40.996
This is...

669
00:38:40.996 --> 00:38:42.125
Give it another shot.

670
00:38:42.125 --> 00:38:44.545
Confessing your feelings
to her, I mean. Trust me.

671
00:38:44.545 --> 00:38:46.929
You are a disciple who has
surpassed his teacher, after all.

672
00:38:47.777 --> 00:38:51.000
So the end result of your first love
has to be different from mine, right?

673

<i>This caller is unavailable.

676
00:39:27.686 --> 00:39:29.534
Put this on before you go to bed.

677
00:39:31.112 --> 00:39:32.233
Just leave it there.

678
00:39:38.307 --> 00:39:41.460
What would you have done today if it
hadn't been for your homeroom teacher?

679
00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.355
You're not going to ask me why I did it?

680
00:39:45.041 --> 00:39:46.998
Why I took the blame for it?

681
00:39:46.998 --> 00:39:49.717
Well, I'm sure you had a good
enough reason for doing so.

682
00:39:53.882 --> 00:39:56.050
You don't need to be
good at studying

683
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:57.726
and you can get into trouble
a couple of times, too.

684
00:39:58.327 --> 00:40:01.371
But... don't hurt other people.

685
00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:03.780
That's the only thing.

686
00:40:14.608 --> 00:40:16.128
What's this?

687
00:40:16.128 --> 00:40:17.509
Isn't it a women's ring?

688
00:40:18.324 --> 00:40:20.177
Um, it's for you, Mom!
Yeah. For you.

689
00:40:20.177 --> 00:40:21.340
I was going to give it to you, Mom.

690
00:40:22.306 --> 00:40:24.885
Why are you taking it away from me, then?
If it's mine, then give it to me.

691
00:40:24.885 --> 00:40:25.932
Okay.

692
00:40:26.429 --> 00:40:28.652
Let me see if it fits.

693
00:40:29.405 --> 00:40:31.021
I'm... I'm heading out for a bit!

694
00:40:31.784 --> 00:40:33.181
Where are you going,
in the middle of the night?

695
00:40:41.244 --> 00:40:42.356
Mom.

696
00:40:45.262 --> 00:40:47.164
I'm sorry about before.

697
00:41:22.398 --> 00:41:24.242
Oh man, the screen is cracked!

698
00:41:34.981 --> 00:41:36.684
Shin Woo?

699
00:41:46.467 --> 00:41:47.831
What's going on...

700
00:41:48.831 --> 00:41:50.554
Hey, what happened to you?

701
00:41:50.554 --> 00:41:51.643
Oh.

702
00:41:51.643 --> 00:41:55.065
It's just that I ran here, since none
of the buses are running anymore.

703
00:41:55.065 --> 00:41:57.074
You ran here, even though
you're injured?

704
00:41:57.074 --> 00:41:58.148
Our homeroom teacher...

705
00:41:58.722 --> 00:42:00.632
quit his job.

706
00:42:02.027 --> 00:42:04.373
He said he's leaving
early this morning.

707
00:42:05.675 --> 00:42:06.981
And...

708
00:42:09.903 --> 00:42:11.971
I figured that you'd want to see him.

709
00:42:25.172 --> 00:42:26.347
What?

710
00:42:26.347 --> 00:42:27.963
See who before I go, now?

711
00:42:28.653 --> 00:42:31.592
He's like a mouse who is being
considerate of a cat.

712

715
00:42:55.599 --> 00:42:58.353
<i>and end up not wanting
to leave, forever?</i>

716
00:42:59.463 --> 00:43:01.494
What is he planning to do then?

717

719
00:43:08.998 --> 00:43:10.829
<i>Because...</i>

720
00:43:11.534 --> 00:43:14.132
<i>Ji Soo will definitely be
waiting for me there.</i>

721
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.083
<i>Because this definitely won't be
the last time that I see her.</i>

722
00:43:20.958 --> 00:43:23.186
<i>Because I'll be able to see her again.</i>
