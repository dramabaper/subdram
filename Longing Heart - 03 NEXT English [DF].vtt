- Hey.
- Oh my gosh.

00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:36.985 line:93%
Mr. Kang!

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:39.394 line:93%
Aw, come on, just one sip!

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:43.412 line:93%
What's the point of asking permission
after you already drank it?

00:00:43.998 --> 00:00:44.998 line:93%
Ugh, gross.

00:00:44.998 --> 00:00:46.236 line:93%
You can have this,
Mr. Kang.

00:00:46.236 --> 00:00:48.324 line:93%
Wow, you're unbelievable!

00:00:48.324 --> 00:00:50.357 line:93%
You had no problem eating a
certain someone's leftovers

00:00:50.357 --> 00:00:53.473 line:93%
and yet it's gross when I take
a sip of your drink? Huh?

00:00:53.473 --> 00:00:55.132 line:93%
Ugh, this is so embarrassing.

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:58.472 line:93%
Wait, so who's this person
that you like so much?

00:00:58.472 --> 00:00:59.543 line:93%
- Huh?
- I don't know.

00:00:59.543 --> 00:01:01.600 line:93%
- Who is it?
- I don't know what you're talking about!

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.657 line:93%
Just tell me!

00:01:02.657 --> 00:01:04.665 line:93%
- Let's hurry!
- Hurry!

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:05.865 line:93%
Huh?

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.836 line:93%
- Wow, what's going on?
- I can't believe it!

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:12.124 line:93%
- No way!
- Wow!

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:14.701 line:93%
Who is it?

00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:19.362 line:93%
I want to make things official
between us, and go out with you.

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:21.439 line:93%
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.401 line:93%
- Go out with him! Go out with him!
- Go out with him! Go out with him!

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:26.943 line:93%
I'm sorry, Senior.

00:01:26.943 --> 00:01:29.362 line:93%
I can't accept this.

00:01:29.362 --> 00:01:33.288 line:93%
There's someone else that I like.

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:42.455 line:93%
<i>This is the moment</i>

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:45.220 line:93%
<i>when things when downhill for us.</i>

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:48.356 line:93%
Yeah...

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:52.913 line:93%
it's a losing game, anyway.

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:56.139 line:93%
<i>If I'd just confessed
my feelings to Ji Soo back then...</i>

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.172 line:93%
<i>We have a car accident
victim in critical condition!</i>

00:01:59.172 --> 00:02:01.551 line:93%
- How's her blood pressure?
- 140, but dropping fast!

00:02:03.182 --> 00:02:04.892 line:93%
150 Joules!
Shock!

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:08.989 line:93%
<i>But if we're destined to be
in each other's lives</i>

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.575 line:93%
<i>I'm sure that it's for a bad reason.</i>

00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:11.827 line:93%
<i>Let's...</i>

00:02:11.827 --> 00:02:15.349 line:93%
<i>never see each other again,
for both our sakes.</i>

00:02:17.122 --> 00:02:19.331 line:93%
<i>Maybe what happened on the day
when we saw each other...</i>

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:22.665 line:93%
<i>for the first time in
ten years has changed, too.</i>

00:02:28.634 --> 00:02:30.671 line:93%
Can I ask who it is?

00:02:31.307 --> 00:02:32.410 line:93%
What?

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.115 line:93%
I'll have to be convinced

00:02:34.115 --> 00:02:38.713 line:93%
that they're better than me
if I'm going to give up on you.

00:02:42.857 --> 00:02:44.319 line:93%
Hey, Third Year.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.532 line:93%
Sorry for butting in, but...

00:02:47.224 --> 00:02:48.422 line:93%
Mr. Kang!

00:02:48.422 --> 00:02:49.808 line:93%
There are rules when it
comes to confessions.

00:02:49.808 --> 00:02:50.890 line:93%
And one of them is

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.890 line:93%
"it's up to you to
convince yourself to get over her."

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.948 line:93%
It's not polite to make the
other person feel awkward

00:02:54.948 --> 00:02:56.855 line:93%
just to make yourself feel better.

00:02:56.855 --> 00:02:58.449 line:93%
You may be a teacher and all

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.288 line:93%
but I think it's also rude of you
to butt in at a time like this, sir.

00:03:01.288 --> 00:03:03.767 line:93%
The thing, is, though,
there are rules at school, too.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:06.065 line:93%
One of them being, "students must
go to the classroom at the bell."

00:03:06.065 --> 00:03:07.812 line:93%
It's been a while since the bell rang.

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.151 line:93%
Hurry up and get inside the classroom!

00:03:09.151 --> 00:03:11.730 line:93%
- Oh man!
- Did you see that?

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.562 line:93%
- Whoo!
- I'm sorry, Senior.

00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:23.103 line:93%
Come to think of it

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:26.772 line:93%
it may be that Third Year's fault
that my life ended up this way!

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:28.938 line:93%
Ugh!

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.496 line:93%
There's... someone that she likes?

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:49.479 line:93%
Write a letter to the you that you
hope to be, ten years from now.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.896 line:93%
You can write whatever you want.

00:03:51.896 --> 00:03:55.163 line:93%
The thing about words is
that they have power.

00:03:55.163 --> 00:03:59.200 line:93%
And those words can guide you toward
a future that you want for yourself.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.797 line:93%
That's the objective
of this homework assignment.

00:04:00.797 --> 00:04:03.638 line:93%
I'd like it to be a video file,
if at all possible

00:04:03.638 --> 00:04:05.425 line:93%
and it'll be due by tonight.

00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:07.376 line:93%
As for the submission method,
send it to my email address.

00:04:07.376 --> 00:04:12.366 line:93%
And now, use the remainder of your time
thinking about what you should say.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.554 line:93%
<i>I wonder what he'll want to say to me?</i>

00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:31.025 line:93%
<i>Who's the person that Ji Soo likes?</i>

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:33.753 line:93%
<i>Ugh, who is it?</i>

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:37.397 line:93%
You, you, you, you, you!

00:04:37.397 --> 00:04:39.001 line:93%
Pardon?

00:04:40.183 --> 00:04:42.150 line:93%
Um, Mr. Kang.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.938 line:93%
What would you want to say to
the you living 10 years in the future?

00:04:46.938 --> 00:04:48.137 line:93%
Well...

00:04:48.743 --> 00:04:52.421 line:93%
rather than that, there's something I'd
want to say to myself 10 years ago.

00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:53.719 line:93%
What would you want to say?

00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:57.342 line:93%
- Ugh!
- Ah!

00:04:57.342 --> 00:04:58.977 line:93%
Stop being so dense.

00:05:01.796 --> 00:05:03.481 line:93%
I'd tell myself to confess.

00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:06.128 line:93%
To not lose her to anyone,
only to regret it later.

00:05:06.128 --> 00:05:07.736 line:93%
And to not lose her.

00:05:07.736 --> 00:05:11.292 line:93%
That's what I'd want to say to
the me from 10 years ago.

00:05:11.292 --> 00:05:14.315 line:93%
Does that mean that you never
got to confess your feelings?

00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:15.844 line:93%
Ten years ago, I mean.

00:05:16.614 --> 00:05:17.674 line:93%
Yep.

00:05:17.674 --> 00:05:19.469 line:93%
Why couldn't you confess?

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.323 line:93%
Because I was stupid
and cowardly.

00:05:22.157 --> 00:05:25.441 line:93%
I was so stupid that I didn't know the
feelings of the person I liked...

00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:30.106 line:93%
and I was such a coward that
I gave up in fear of getting hurt.

00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:33.221 line:93%
In the end, I was never able
to convey my feelings to her

00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:35.945 line:93%
and those feelings turned into
feelings of regret.

00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:37.777 line:93%
But I know now

00:05:37.777 --> 00:05:44.726 line:93%
that I had a chance of changing my
future if only I'd confessed back then.

00:05:44.726 --> 00:05:49.145 line:93%
But if you don't do anything just
because you're scared of getting hurt

00:05:49.145 --> 00:05:51.200 line:93%
nothing will change.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.051 line:93%
So, I'd like it if all of you
remembered that

00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:58.169 line:93%
love starts with a confession.

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.363 line:93%
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

00:06:17.114 --> 00:06:18.642 line:93%
A confession, huh?

00:06:31.388 --> 00:06:33.428 line:93%
<i>[My birthday]</i>

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.726 line:93%
So, tomorrow is Mr. Kang's
birthday, huh?

00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:45.977 line:93%
I'll probably be a civil servant
10 years from now.

00:06:45.977 --> 00:06:47.450 line:93%
A civil servant?

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.854 line:93%
Why a civil servant?

00:06:48.854 --> 00:06:50.871 line:93%
Now I have to
record it over again!

00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:53.964 line:93%
Since when did I have a friend who
wanted to become a civil servant?

00:06:53.964 --> 00:06:56.448 line:93%
You get a decent salary and a pension,
and they even have a set retirement age!

00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:57.659 line:93%
There isn't a job that
can compare to that!

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:59.121 line:93%
Wasn't it your dream to
become a cartoonist, though?

00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:00.611 line:93%
A cartoonist?
Oh, please.

00:07:01.258 --> 00:07:02.428 line:93%
I'm not trying to starve.

00:07:02.428 --> 00:07:04.590 line:93%
Why not? You've always
been good at drawing.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.748 line:93%
That's just a skill.

00:07:05.748 --> 00:07:07.885 line:93%
To not starve,
you need to have an innate talent.

00:07:07.885 --> 00:07:10.679 line:93%
And my innate talent isn't drawing,
it's facing reality.

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:12.717 line:93%
But even so, I feel like it'd
be such a waste of talent.

00:07:12.717 --> 00:07:14.479 line:93%
Oh, whatever, whatever.
This is all ruined now.

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:16.205 line:93%
Here, you go first,
Choo Geun Deok.

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:17.796 line:93%
Is it recording?

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.575 line:93%
Is this angle okay?

00:07:22.111 --> 00:07:25.243 line:93%
To be honest, I have a single wish.

00:07:25.243 --> 00:07:28.407 line:93%
I really want myself to have
experienced this once after 10 years.

00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:29.489 line:93%
Experience what?

00:07:33.298 --> 00:07:34.512 line:93%
My first love!

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.979 line:93%
I probably will have experienced it
once after 10 years, right?

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:42.914 line:93%
I probably will have really, really liked
someone once by then, right?

00:07:42.914 --> 00:07:44.642 line:93%
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:07:44.642 --> 00:07:47.178 line:93%
You've gone through an entire
platoon's worth of women.

00:07:47.178 --> 00:07:48.195 line:93%
My sentiments exactly.

00:07:48.195 --> 00:07:52.443 line:93%
Hey, this is like hearing Park Ji Sung
say, "I want to score a goal just once."

00:07:52.443 --> 00:07:54.596 line:93%
The reason why I keep dating
around is because

00:07:54.596 --> 00:07:56.746 line:93%
I never end up really liking a girl,
even when I date her.

00:07:56.746 --> 00:07:58.881 line:93%
I've never experienced
that feeling, even once.

00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:00.554 line:93%
I have no idea what it feels like
to really like someone.

00:08:00.554 --> 00:08:02.364 line:93%
That's why I envy Shin Woo.

00:08:02.364 --> 00:08:05.150 line:93%
It makes me wonder, "how much must
he like Han Ji Soo to act this way?"

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.166 line:93%
Wow.

00:08:06.166 --> 00:08:08.863 line:93%
I wish I could combine you two,
and then split you apart again.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.842 line:93%
Your power to just
act without thinking

00:08:10.842 --> 00:08:12.457 line:93%
and your ability to harbor
innocent, pure affection.

00:08:12.457 --> 00:08:15.229 line:93%
Well, you can consider me an
affectionate man of action now.

00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:18.121 line:93%
I'm...

00:08:19.185 --> 00:08:20.813 line:93%
going to confess.

00:08:21.912 --> 00:08:24.022 line:93%
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:08:34.026 --> 00:08:37.756 line:93%
I'm going to meet up with her on
my birthday, and confess to her.

00:08:38.354 --> 00:08:39.575 line:93%
Tomorrow.

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:47.805 line:93%
Let's go.

00:08:57.271 --> 00:09:01.099 line:93%
<i>Sunday is my birthday, and
I have something to tell you then.</i>

00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:03.883 line:93%
<i>Let's meet up at the
City Meeting Spot at 6 p.m. tomorrow.</i>

00:09:03.883 --> 00:09:07.642 line:93%
It says it's his birthday tomorrow, so...
did Mr. Kang leave me this note?

00:09:10.989 --> 00:09:14.033 line:93%
<i>[From: Kang Shin Woo]</i>

00:09:20.854 --> 00:09:24.932 line:93%
Hey, you can't confess empty-handed!

00:09:26.186 --> 00:09:29.398 line:93%
Even so, isn't a ring
too over-the-top?

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.398 line:93%
What if she feels like it's too much?

00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:32.824 line:93%
Let's think about this
optimistically for a second.

00:09:32.824 --> 00:09:36.330 line:93%
She could end up liking the ring
even if she doesn't like you

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.089 line:93%
which could lead to her
accepting your confession.

00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:41.929 line:93%
Shut your trap!

00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:47.050 line:93%
- How about something more...
- Yeah.

00:10:00.276 --> 00:10:02.339 line:93%
How does this look?
Does it look okay?

00:10:02.339 --> 00:10:04.120 line:93%
Ooh, it's nice.

00:10:04.588 --> 00:10:06.599 line:93%
Why are you shopping for
men's clothes, though?

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:09.173 line:93%
I'm thinking of buying clothes
as a birthday gift.

00:10:09.922 --> 00:10:11.352 line:93%
A birthday gift?

00:10:12.365 --> 00:10:15.956 line:93%
I want to give him a gift,
and I have something to tell him, too.

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:25.413 line:93%
Oh!

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.685 line:93%
What are you guys
doing in the city?

00:10:27.685 --> 00:10:29.127 line:93%
Oh, we're buying a gift.

00:10:29.127 --> 00:10:30.931 line:93%
A gift?
What gift?

00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:33.110 line:93%
Well, it's Shin Woo's
birthday tomorrow.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.658 line:93%
So we bought Shin Woo
a birthday gift.

00:10:34.658 --> 00:10:36.965 line:93%
Oh yeah, Shin Woo's birthday
is tomorrow, isn't it?

00:10:37.624 --> 00:10:40.315 line:93%
Oh, so then that was for
you, Shin Woo!

00:10:40.315 --> 00:10:41.435 line:93%
What are you talking about?

00:10:41.435 --> 00:10:43.242 line:93%
I think Ji Soo bought
a present for you.

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:44.714 line:93%
Really?

00:10:44.714 --> 00:10:46.733 line:93%
Yeah. Are you guys planning
to meet up tomorrow?

00:10:47.219 --> 00:10:48.293 line:93%
Yeah.

00:10:48.293 --> 00:10:50.364 line:93%
Oh, what's this?
Are we all meeting up together?

00:10:50.364 --> 00:10:51.633 line:93%
What time, and where?

00:10:51.633 --> 00:10:53.739 line:93%
Hey, the bus is here.
Just get on the bus.

00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:55.623 line:93%
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

00:10:57.305 --> 00:10:59.435 line:93%
Godspeed, dude!

00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:06.739 line:93%
Ooh, there's no way that Ji Soo
will be a no-show tomorrow!

00:11:06.739 --> 00:11:09.343 line:93%
Oh my gosh, dude!
What do I even say to her?

00:11:09.343 --> 00:11:10.461 line:93%
What should I say to her tomorrow?

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:12.800 line:93%
"I love you, Ji Soo."

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.676 line:93%
Ugh, give me a break!

00:11:16.456 --> 00:11:17.833 line:93%
Hey, Kim Min Seok.

00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:19.004 line:93%
Is something up?

00:11:19.004 --> 00:11:20.099 line:93%
Huh?

00:11:20.099 --> 00:11:23.179 line:93%
You aren't in a good mood,
it's written all over your face.

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:25.881 line:93%
No, of course not.
Everything is fine.

00:11:28.941 --> 00:11:30.046 line:93%
How did you know?

00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:33.041 line:93%
We've lived in the same two-family
home for 10 years, so of course I'd know.

00:11:33.041 --> 00:11:35.907 line:93%
I can even tell what you ate
just by hearing you poop.

00:11:35.907 --> 00:11:38.740 line:93%
Ugh, why do you have to use
such disgusting examples?

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.771 line:93%
Oh yeah, I have something
to give to you.

00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:41.946 line:93%
What?

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.844 line:93%
Your underwear!

00:11:44.844 --> 00:11:46.879 line:93%
You psycho!

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:51.189 line:93%
Why is it that stuff keeps flying from
your room to mine when the wind blows?

00:11:51.189 --> 00:11:54.210 line:93%
Clip your clothes tightly
when you hang them to dry.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.267 line:93%
It's not like this is something
that I was dying to see.

00:11:58.045 --> 00:11:59.238 line:93%
Bu the way...

00:11:59.901 --> 00:12:01.089 line:93%
Those are knock-offs, right?

00:12:01.089 --> 00:12:02.137 line:93%
No!

00:12:02.137 --> 00:12:03.166 line:93%
Yeah, right.

00:12:04.969 --> 00:12:06.403 line:93%
How did you know that, too?

00:12:06.403 --> 00:12:08.695 line:93%
This is a top-notch knock-off
that I got airmailed to me.

00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:12.511 line:93%
How could I possibly confuse
that fake for the real thing?

00:12:12.511 --> 00:12:14.998 line:93%
Ugh, don't you know that
I have an eye for these things?

00:12:15.666 --> 00:12:18.094 line:93%
Well yeah, that's true.

00:12:19.423 --> 00:12:20.435 line:93%
Oh yeah.

00:12:20.435 --> 00:12:23.232 line:93%
What did you say that
you wanted to be, in ten years?

00:12:30.233 --> 00:12:34.614 line:93%
So, this is the letter
I'm sending to myself.

00:12:35.349 --> 00:12:37.447 line:93%
Man, I'm kind of nervous to watch this.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.566 line:93%
<i>Go ahead and talk to the you
who is 10 years in the future.</i>

00:12:42.566 --> 00:12:44.526 line:93%
<i>I don't really have much to say.</i>

00:12:44.526 --> 00:12:48.941 line:93%
<i>I'm sure you have something you want to
become, or something you want by then!</i>

00:12:48.941 --> 00:12:51.420 line:93%
<i>Well...</i>

00:12:52.195 --> 00:12:55.277 line:93%
<i>I don't really care, as long
as I'm not starving to death.</i>

00:12:56.364 --> 00:12:58.643 line:93%
- Thanks a lot, jerk.
<i>- Mr. Kang is going to yell at you.</i></i>

00:12:58.643 --> 00:13:01.960 line:93%
I totally feel like I lived
a worthwhile life now.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.790 line:93%
<i>Mr. Kang said words have power.</i>

00:13:12.007 --> 00:13:14.687 line:93%
Yes, this is the Night Duty Room
at Garam High School.

00:13:14.687 --> 00:13:17.081 line:93%
<i>Mr. Kang!
It's me, Baek Na Hee.</i>

00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:18.564 line:93%
Oh, Ms. Baek!

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:19.990 line:93%
<i>Yes.
What are you up to?</i>

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.665 line:93%
<i>About the drinks you promised me.
I want them tomorrow.</i>

00:13:23.665 --> 00:13:25.500 line:93%
Um...

00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:27.649 line:93%
all right, sure.

00:13:27.649 --> 00:13:28.932 line:93%
Let's meet up tomorrow.

00:13:29.378 --> 00:13:30.431 line:93%
Yes.

00:13:31.297 --> 00:13:32.636 line:93%
All right.

00:13:36.109 --> 00:13:40.287 line:93%
I'll have to hurry and wrap things up
with Na Hee too, won't I?

00:13:48.033 --> 00:13:49.320 line:93%
Big Sis.

00:13:50.259 --> 00:13:51.714 line:93%
Have you ever been
confessed to before?

00:13:51.714 --> 00:13:53.102 line:93%
- A confession?
- Yeah.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.807 line:93%
Did you take money
out of my wallet again--

00:13:54.807 --> 00:13:56.987 line:93%
No, no, I mean from a guy!
Like, a romantic confession!

00:13:56.987 --> 00:13:58.296 line:93%
Nothing like that!

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.604 line:93%
Has a guy ever confessed to you before!

00:14:01.162 --> 00:14:03.083 line:93%
Of course I have.

00:14:03.083 --> 00:14:07.974 line:93%
Then, what was the best
confession you ever got?

00:14:07.974 --> 00:14:09.555 line:93%
Well...

00:14:11.774 --> 00:14:13.536 line:93%
the one from the
most handsome guy.

00:14:14.998 --> 00:14:16.061 line:93%
Okay, what was
the next best one?

00:14:16.061 --> 00:14:18.392 line:93%
The one from the
second most handsome guy.

00:14:18.392 --> 00:14:21.956 line:93%
I should've known better than
to expect a good answer from you.

00:14:21.956 --> 00:14:23.295 line:93%
Ugh!

00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:25.575 line:93%
You're never any help!

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:28.070 line:93%
What's his problem?

00:14:57.176 --> 00:14:59.147 line:93%
<i>Knowing your place</i>

00:14:59.147 --> 00:15:01.787 line:93%
<i>and facing reality is the innate
talent that you was born with...</i>

00:15:01.787 --> 00:15:03.538 line:93%
<i>Kim Min Seok.</i>

00:15:08.018 --> 00:15:09.194 line:93%
Oh!

00:15:10.283 --> 00:15:12.041 line:93%
Damn it!

00:15:13.353 --> 00:15:14.804 line:93%
Ugh.

00:15:20.397 --> 00:15:23.551 line:93%
<i>Hey, Jang So Ra.
I'm coming in for a bit.</i>

00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:26.942 line:93%
What brings you here at this hour?

00:15:26.942 --> 00:15:28.540 line:93%
Oh, um, nothing, really.

00:15:34.849 --> 00:15:37.468 line:93%
Hey, what's all this?

00:15:37.468 --> 00:15:38.941 line:93%
These are all the drawings
that I threw away.

00:15:38.941 --> 00:15:40.155 line:93%
My investments.

00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:42.283 line:93%
Don't you know that
art can turn into cash?

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.700 line:93%
Yeah, but not just any old drawing
will sell for a high price.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.331 line:93%
I bet they'll sell for tons of money
once you become a famous artist.

00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:48.699 line:93%
What do you mean, become famous?

00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:52.421 line:93%
I told you. The things I say are
the real deal are the real deal.

00:15:52.421 --> 00:15:55.175 line:93%
If you try to steal these
from me later, I'll kill you.

00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:59.565 line:93%
I'm telling you this now, but it cost me
a lot of money to get those framed.

00:15:59.565 --> 00:16:01.807 line:93%
I was told that they'd sell
for a higher price that way.

00:16:06.292 --> 00:16:09.267 line:93%
Hey, are you crying?
Why are you crying?

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:13.883 line:93%
H-hey. What's the matter?
Are you feeling sick?

00:16:14.378 --> 00:16:16.732 line:93%
Why are you making me
excited about this again?

00:16:17.214 --> 00:16:18.239 line:93%
Huh?

00:16:18.239 --> 00:16:21.508 line:93%
Why are you doing this, when I'd
completely given up on it already?

00:16:21.508 --> 00:16:23.998 line:93%
Why are you making me
hopeful and excited again?

00:16:33.542 --> 00:16:36.056 line:93%
She said that there is
a person she likes

00:16:36.056 --> 00:16:38.522 line:93%
so maybe I'll get rejected.

00:16:42.828 --> 00:16:45.595 line:93%
How will I face Ji Soo
if she rejects me?

00:16:49.581 --> 00:16:51.604 line:93%
Oh, whatever!

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:54.662 line:93%
I still have to try.

00:17:06.373 --> 00:17:07.847 line:93%
<i>Ji Soo.</i>

00:17:10.074 --> 00:17:13.412 line:93%
<i>I... like you.</i>

00:17:13.412 --> 00:17:16.767 line:93%
<i>[Ji Soo. I like you!!!]</i>

00:17:17.313 --> 00:17:19.287 line:93%
<i>Being uncertain of the future.</i>

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.271 line:93%
<i>And being uncertain of
others' feelings.</i>

00:17:24.739 --> 00:17:26.860 line:93%
<i>The reason why</i>

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.151 line:93%
<i>one must muster the
courage to venture forth</i>

00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:32.297 line:93%
<i>despite all these uncertainties...</i>

00:17:34.836 --> 00:17:38.018 line:93%
<i>is because the future
holds potential.</i>

00:17:54.487 --> 00:17:56.543 line:93%
<i>One may have one's
confession turned down</i>

00:17:56.543 --> 00:17:58.778 line:93%
<i>or fail to achieve one's dreams.</i>

00:17:58.778 --> 00:18:04.073 line:93%
<i>But there's also a chance that
neither of those things will happen.</i>

00:18:05.286 --> 00:18:06.682 line:93%
I'll be graduating in two years anyway

00:18:06.682 --> 00:18:11.962 line:93%
so I can just think of this as a
confession that's two years early.

00:18:25.613 --> 00:18:27.940 line:93%
Let's just go like this,
all nice and fresh.

00:18:29.111 --> 00:18:30.719 line:93%
I can do it.

00:19:00.585 --> 00:19:01.733 line:93%
Oh, Mr. Kang--

00:19:01.733 --> 00:19:03.190 line:93%
- Mr. Kang!
- Oh!

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.239 line:93%
- Let's go, Ms. Baek.
- All right.

00:19:37.497 --> 00:19:39.287 line:93%
I'm sorry.

00:19:42.934 --> 00:19:44.499 line:93%
Shin Woo.

00:19:45.144 --> 00:19:46.554 line:93%
Are you... crying?

00:19:47.824 --> 00:19:50.018 line:93%
What's the matter?
Did something happen?

00:19:51.238 --> 00:19:52.909 line:93%
What's the matter?

00:19:53.544 --> 00:19:54.920 line:93%
Because I like him.

00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:56.894 line:93%
Huh?

00:20:01.912 --> 00:20:03.834 line:93%
Because I like...

00:20:04.379 --> 00:20:05.583 line:93%
Mr. Kang.

00:20:16.506 --> 00:20:18.398 line:93%
Welcome!

00:20:18.983 --> 00:20:20.104 line:93%
- Hey.
- Yeah?

00:20:20.104 --> 00:20:21.213 line:93%
Let me lay low for a bit.

00:20:21.213 --> 00:20:23.315 line:93%
If my homeroom teacher sees me,
I'll get punished!

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.002 line:93%
Give us two pints
of beer from the tap!

00:20:26.002 --> 00:20:27.103 line:93%
Sure.

00:20:27.103 --> 00:20:28.754 line:93%
Let's have a great time.

00:20:33.592 --> 00:20:34.829 line:93%
Thank you.

00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:42.221 line:93%
Um, why are you drinking
your beer in such a hurry?

00:20:42.915 --> 00:20:44.814 line:93%
Because there's something
I must tell you quickly.

00:20:44.814 --> 00:20:46.706 line:93%
Um, sure.

00:20:48.694 --> 00:20:50.091 line:93%
Mr. Kang.

00:20:50.091 --> 00:20:51.376 line:93%
Let's date each other.

00:20:52.821 --> 00:20:54.994 line:93%
Um... wait just a second.

00:20:54.994 --> 00:20:58.486 line:93%
I actually had something to talk
to you about regarding that.

00:20:58.486 --> 00:21:00.400 line:93%
I think you've got the
wrong idea about something

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.567 line:93%
so I want to
set things straight.

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.754 line:93%
I'm actually not from Seoul.

00:21:05.754 --> 00:21:08.125 line:93%
I just came from there since
my first assignment was in Seoul.

00:21:08.125 --> 00:21:11.264 line:93%
So, will we become official
as of today, then?

00:21:11.264 --> 00:21:15.316 line:93%
No, I'm saying that this place,
which you hate, is my hometown!

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.151 line:93%
I'm from this town!

00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:18.639 line:93%
And I graduated from
our high school, too.

00:21:18.639 --> 00:21:19.720 line:93%
Oh my, really?

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.520 line:93%
I can't believe that we have
so much in common!

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.171 line:93%
We're from the same town,
and even went to the same school?

00:21:25.171 --> 00:21:28.433 line:93%
The homeroom teacher is from our
town, and graduated from our school?

00:21:28.433 --> 00:21:30.422 line:93%
What are you saying?

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:32.880 line:93%
Your ideal guy is a guy
from Seoul, Ms. Baek!

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.605 line:93%
And the one rule you have
for yourself in dating

00:21:34.605 --> 00:21:36.254 line:93%
is to not date guys from this town!

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:38.898 line:93%
And I'm exactly the type of
guy whom you'd never date!

00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:42.504 line:93%
Well, I didn't know that I'd
meet you back then, Mr. Kang.

00:21:42.504 --> 00:21:44.758 line:93%
I'll just change my
ideal type of guy, then.

00:21:45.587 --> 00:21:46.921 line:93%
To guys from our hometown.

00:21:48.614 --> 00:21:51.492 line:93%
How could you just change your
ideal type of guy like that?

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:55.921 line:93%
But, why is it that your face
is unfamiliar to me, then?

00:21:55.921 --> 00:21:58.733 line:93%
This town is so small that
I pretty much know everyone.

00:21:58.733 --> 00:22:01.757 line:93%
Exactly. Why don't the teachers
or anyone else know him, then?

00:22:02.344 --> 00:22:04.796 line:93%
Um, let's stop discussing that for now.

00:22:04.796 --> 00:22:07.451 line:93%
Let me rectify the current
situation we're in right now, then.

00:22:09.485 --> 00:22:12.035 line:93%
I like another woman.

00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:17.524 line:93%
W-well, you only like her.
It's not like you're dating her.

00:22:17.524 --> 00:22:20.258 line:93%
Because of that woman,
I didn't date anyone for ten years.

00:22:20.258 --> 00:22:23.248 line:93%
And I'm planning to wait
ten more years for her.

00:22:23.957 --> 00:22:26.220 line:93%
Are you really okay with that?

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:29.999 line:93%
<i>Three.</i>

00:22:30.483 --> 00:22:31.483 line:93%
<i>Two.</i>

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:33.090 line:93%
<i>One.</i>

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.593 line:93%
Dagnabbit!
Ugh!

00:22:36.767 --> 00:22:39.116 line:93%
The English teacher
said "dagnabbit!"

00:22:39.116 --> 00:22:41.262 line:93%
Oh, it's on!

00:22:44.764 --> 00:22:47.664 line:93%
<i>[Our homeroom teacher and the
English teacher are at my workplace!]</i>

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:56.014 line:93%
So...

00:22:57.466 --> 00:22:59.677 line:93%
today is the homeroom
teacher's birthday

00:22:59.677 --> 00:23:02.056 line:93%
and you were planning
to confess to him?

00:23:04.175 --> 00:23:06.584 line:93%
That's what I'd planned to do.

00:23:07.716 --> 00:23:09.621 line:93%
But I completely failed.

00:23:11.238 --> 00:23:12.633 line:93%
Wow.

00:23:12.633 --> 00:23:14.768 line:93%
I can't believe you're
seeing this side of me.

00:23:15.383 --> 00:23:17.965 line:93%
I scared you a little, didn't I?
I'm sorry.

00:23:19.592 --> 00:23:21.887 line:93%
Just how much do you like
the homeroom teacher?

00:23:24.917 --> 00:23:27.784 line:93%
Do you like him so much that there's
no space for anyone else in your heart...

00:23:29.514 --> 00:23:32.850 line:93%
and do you like him so much
that it has to be him...

00:23:34.867 --> 00:23:36.565 line:93%
and nobody else will do?

00:23:40.071 --> 00:23:43.152 line:93%
I feel so embarrassed in front
of you right now...

00:23:46.309 --> 00:23:48.595 line:93%
and I feel so embarrassed
that I could just die, but...

00:23:50.684 --> 00:23:54.499 line:93%
the thought that Mr. Kang may like
someone else that I don't know about...

00:23:56.424 --> 00:23:58.207 line:93%
makes me feel...

00:24:01.545 --> 00:24:08.255 line:93%
But meeting up with you like this and
talking about it made me feel better.

00:24:09.469 --> 00:24:13.362 line:93%
But, weren't you supposed
to go somewhere today?

00:24:13.362 --> 00:24:15.809 line:93%
Why did you come out
to the city today?

00:24:15.809 --> 00:24:16.813 line:93%
Well...

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.475 line:93%
I just had something to do, is all.

00:24:28.604 --> 00:24:29.604 line:93%
Let's go.

00:24:30.625 --> 00:24:31.767 line:93%
Where?

00:24:31.767 --> 00:24:35.480 line:93%
Let's take you to go and
do what you wanted to do.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.630 line:93%
Huh?

00:24:46.346 --> 00:24:48.890 line:93%
Um, it's not that I was trying
to keep this from you.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.239 line:93%
- I just didn't have a chance to tell--
- Oh, can it!

00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:52.364 line:93%
Humph!

00:24:52.934 --> 00:24:55.123 line:93%
Um, Ms. Baek!

00:24:55.123 --> 00:24:56.142 line:93%
Where are you going?

00:24:56.142 --> 00:24:59.523 line:93%
Ow!
Ow!

00:24:59.523 --> 00:25:01.169 line:93%
Ugh, just you watch!

00:25:01.169 --> 00:25:03.789 line:93%
I'll get my revenge!
Ugh!

00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:06.957 line:93%
Wait, Ms. Baek!
Ms. Baek!

00:25:06.957 --> 00:25:08.376 line:93%
Choo Geun Deok!

00:25:08.376 --> 00:25:09.870 line:93%
Get your butt out here, now!

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.019 line:93%
Damn it.

00:25:12.871 --> 00:25:15.633 line:93%
How did you know
that I worked here part-time?

00:25:15.633 --> 00:25:17.465 line:93%
That's the reason
I came here in the first place.

00:25:17.465 --> 00:25:18.931 line:93%
So I could ask you to
take care of the rest.

00:25:18.931 --> 00:25:20.682 line:93%
- Hurry and go after her.
- What?

00:25:20.682 --> 00:25:23.335 line:93%
I can't just let a lady go home
by herself when she's drunk!

00:25:23.335 --> 00:25:25.086 line:93%
The English teacher isn't a lady!

00:25:25.086 --> 00:25:27.117 line:93%
Judging from what I just saw, I bet she
could tear five young guys apart--

00:25:27.117 --> 00:25:28.170 line:93%
Ugh!

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.331 line:93%
Would you rather get punished, then?

00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:31.078 line:93%
Want me to tell the Student Association
that you're working part-time at a pub?

00:25:31.078 --> 00:25:32.260 line:93%
Damn it!

00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:36.874 line:93%
Hey, be careful!

00:25:36.874 --> 00:25:38.325 line:93%
She bites when she's drunk!

00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:40.480 line:93%
Ow!

00:26:00.485 --> 00:26:01.544 line:93%
Oh, what's this?

00:26:02.025 --> 00:26:03.531 line:93%
So he did confess?

00:26:07.066 --> 00:26:08.546 line:93%
I can't do it.

00:26:08.546 --> 00:26:10.565 line:93%
He'll definitely reject me.

00:26:10.565 --> 00:26:13.442 line:93%
How am I supposed to
face him after this?

00:26:18.645 --> 00:26:21.267 line:93%
Just act first,
and think about it later.

00:26:22.294 --> 00:26:24.086 line:93%
Confessions are all about
timing too, after all.

00:26:24.086 --> 00:26:25.325 line:93%
Okay?

00:26:38.251 --> 00:26:39.528 line:93%
Mr. Kang.

00:26:44.342 --> 00:26:45.565 line:93%
"I like you."

00:26:47.059 --> 00:26:48.106 line:93%
What?

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:51.423 line:93%
You said we should confess our feelings.

00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:53.233 line:93%
"I like you."

00:26:53.233 --> 00:26:56.124 line:93%
Hey, I never told you guys
to confess to me!

00:26:56.124 --> 00:26:58.998 line:93%
Why do you keep coming to me
with your confession, since last time?

00:26:58.998 --> 00:27:00.044 line:93%
Hey, punk.

00:27:00.044 --> 00:27:02.107 line:93%
Get your head on straight, and
tell the right person--

00:27:02.107 --> 00:27:03.369 line:93%
That confession...

00:27:04.883 --> 00:27:06.758 line:93%
is my confession.

00:27:10.425 --> 00:27:11.581 line:93%
Huh?

00:27:16.515 --> 00:27:17.565 line:93%
I...

00:27:18.231 --> 00:27:21.387 line:93%
like you, Mr. Kang.

00:27:28.121 --> 00:27:29.369 line:93%
My wish?

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.305 line:93%
I do have one.

00:27:35.165 --> 00:27:37.156 line:93%
That the person I like...

00:27:38.208 --> 00:27:39.990 line:93%
would like me back.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.059 line:93%
It doesn't have to be now.

00:27:44.059 --> 00:27:47.240 line:93%
They can confess to the version of me
from ten years in the future.

00:27:53.077 --> 00:27:57.288 line:93%
Um, I misheard you just now, right?

00:27:57.288 --> 00:27:59.315 line:93%
- Right?
- No.

00:28:00.901 --> 00:28:03.270 line:93%
You probably heard right.

00:28:08.012 --> 00:28:09.315 line:93%
Hey!

00:28:09.315 --> 00:28:11.192 line:93%
Hey, Kang Shin Woo!

00:28:18.238 --> 00:28:22.285 line:93%
Yeah, sure. I totally understand
how that could've happened.

00:28:22.285 --> 00:28:23.960 line:93%
It's really common.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.555 line:93%
It's kind of similar to how kids your age
become obsessed with celebrities.

00:28:27.555 --> 00:28:29.585 line:93%
It's similar to that, so, um...

00:28:29.585 --> 00:28:30.615 line:93%
admiration!

00:28:30.615 --> 00:28:33.739 line:93%
Yeah, that's right!
It's admiration.

00:28:33.739 --> 00:28:37.277 line:93%
I'll just call it
admiration, then.

00:28:38.931 --> 00:28:40.000 line:93%
Huh?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.151 line:93%
If that makes you more
comfortable, that is.

00:28:43.151 --> 00:28:45.846 line:93%
It doesn't matter what I call it.

00:28:45.846 --> 00:28:48.614 line:93%
My feelings won't change
no matter what I call it, anyway.

00:28:48.614 --> 00:28:50.192 line:93%
O... okay.

00:28:51.077 --> 00:28:52.438 line:93%
B-but...

00:28:53.942 --> 00:28:55.783 line:93%
thanks for your affection, but...

00:28:56.334 --> 00:29:00.656 line:93%
if you hadn't said that to me
right now, but someone else...

00:29:01.499 --> 00:29:03.874 line:93%
I would've felt more thankful.

00:29:06.182 --> 00:29:07.623 line:93%
All right.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.623 line:93%
I understand what you're saying,
and how you feel, too.

00:29:10.623 --> 00:29:14.444 line:93%
But, as I'm sure you know,
all I can say to you right now is--

00:29:14.444 --> 00:29:18.225 line:93%
Can't we end things here for today?

00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:23.554 line:93%
It's no fun reading something that
you know the ending of.

00:29:28.244 --> 00:29:30.431 line:93%
W-what's... this?

00:29:30.431 --> 00:29:33.547 line:93%
Happy birthday, Mr. Kang.

00:29:35.504 --> 00:29:37.402 line:93%
Ji Soo!
Han Ji Soo!

00:29:42.046 --> 00:29:43.537 line:93%
Oh, jeez.

00:29:44.688 --> 00:29:46.819 line:93%
Ugh, where did Kang Shin Woo go--

00:29:48.294 --> 00:29:50.477 line:93%
Oh, there's no way I wouldn't know.

00:29:53.334 --> 00:29:55.162 line:93%
I wish I didn't know.

00:30:09.414 --> 00:30:11.357 line:93%
Hey, Kang Shin Woo.

00:30:15.642 --> 00:30:17.008 line:93%
What's this?

00:30:17.008 --> 00:30:21.219 line:93%
I think that you and I
both need this right now.

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:22.894 line:93%
Is it okay for my homeroom
teacher to be doing something like this?

00:30:22.894 --> 00:30:24.690 line:93%
It's your birthday today, after all.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.634 line:93%
It's okay for you to have one drink
that an adult is offering to you.

00:30:35.136 --> 00:30:38.233 line:93%
No thanks, I don't drink
these sorts of things.

00:30:40.499 --> 00:30:41.655 line:93%
Oh, yeah right!

00:30:41.655 --> 00:30:43.596 line:93%
You drank a ton when you
were a First Year.

00:30:43.596 --> 00:30:46.989 line:93%
Hey, Kang Shin Woo!
Let's talk.

00:30:49.658 --> 00:30:51.019 line:93%
About what?

00:30:51.019 --> 00:30:53.788 line:93%
Maybe, about why it had to be your
birthday today, of all days?

00:30:55.425 --> 00:30:56.431 line:93%
No thanks.

00:30:56.431 --> 00:30:58.179 line:93%
If you want to give me
a birthday present

00:30:58.179 --> 00:31:00.866 line:93%
disappear from my sight right now.

00:31:00.866 --> 00:31:03.767 line:93%
Because that's the gift
that I want most right now.

00:31:06.408 --> 00:31:07.454 line:93%
Hey.

00:31:10.251 --> 00:31:11.842 line:93%
What did you even do, then?

00:31:11.842 --> 00:31:14.341 line:93%
I told you to confess, but you
confessed for Ji Soo, instead?

00:31:14.341 --> 00:31:15.752 line:93%
Are you stupid?

00:31:15.752 --> 00:31:18.190 line:93%
You should've confessed your
feelings to Ji Soo first--

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:19.829 line:93%
That wouldn't have changed anything!

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.972 line:93%
I already know how she feels.

00:31:25.521 --> 00:31:27.947 line:93%
It's a losing game, anyway.

00:31:28.979 --> 00:31:32.297 line:93%
It's a losing game, anyway.

00:31:45.316 --> 00:31:49.021 line:93%
<i>History... is repeating itself.</i>

00:31:50.608 --> 00:31:53.689 line:93%
<i>And this time,
the thing that changed...</i>

00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:56.556 line:93%
<i>is that I am my own enemy.</i>

00:32:08.322 --> 00:32:10.390 line:93%
I need to find a way
to make this work out.

00:32:23.577 --> 00:32:25.854 line:93%
How do I give this back to her?

00:32:30.672 --> 00:32:33.221 line:93%
You got home safely last night, right?

00:32:33.221 --> 00:32:36.756 line:93%
None of your business.
Why do you care?

00:32:36.756 --> 00:32:39.341 line:93%
I wasn't worrying about you.
I was worrying about other people.

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:42.489 line:93%
Just look at this!

00:32:42.489 --> 00:32:44.467 line:93%
It's because I'm scared you may
have bitten another innocent person.

00:32:44.467 --> 00:32:45.781 line:93%
Ow, it hurts.

00:32:45.781 --> 00:32:49.641 line:93%
At any rate, I'm going to be
completely cold to you now

00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:53.316 line:93%
so don't talk to me,
or be nice to me, either!

00:32:53.316 --> 00:32:54.883 line:93%
It'll just make things harder
for me if you're nice!

00:32:54.883 --> 00:32:55.923 line:93%
Damn it!

00:33:01.809 --> 00:33:03.855 line:93%
Is that true?

00:33:05.211 --> 00:33:10.960 line:93%
Then... the nicer I am to Ji Soo,
the worse things will get, right?

00:33:16.328 --> 00:33:18.533 line:93%
I have to be cold to her.

00:33:19.154 --> 00:33:20.844 line:93%
Make sure you check
problems like these carefully.

00:33:20.844 --> 00:33:23.970 line:93%
There will probably be a lot of problems
based on today's lesson on the exam.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:25.432 line:93%
Be sure to check over your
own work well, everyone.

00:33:33.598 --> 00:33:34.690 line:93%
Mr. Kang.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.314 line:93%
Yeah?
What is it?

00:33:36.314 --> 00:33:38.584 line:93%
Please have this.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.942 line:93%
You can have this.

00:33:44.942 --> 00:33:47.247 line:93%
Hey, Shin Woo!

00:33:47.247 --> 00:33:48.799 line:93%
Mr. Kang!

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.792 line:93%
- Hello.
- Yeah, hey.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.980 line:93%
Mr. Kang!

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.007 line:93%
Can't we talk?

00:33:59.007 --> 00:34:00.244 line:93%
About what?

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.324 line:93%
- Well--
- I have somewhere to be.

00:34:03.324 --> 00:34:05.418 line:93%
If it's not important,
let's talk later.

00:34:05.418 --> 00:34:06.969 line:93%
Mr. Kang!

00:34:06.969 --> 00:34:08.182 line:93%
Oh, good thing I ran
into you, Ji Soo.

00:34:08.182 --> 00:34:09.771 line:93%
- Can you help me?
- Hey, Kang Shin Woo!

00:34:09.771 --> 00:34:10.903 line:93%
Let's talk.

00:34:10.903 --> 00:34:13.074 line:93%
I have somewhere to be.

00:34:13.074 --> 00:34:15.008 line:93%
If it's not important,
let's talk later.

00:34:15.008 --> 00:34:16.115 line:93%
Hey!

00:34:16.115 --> 00:34:18.220 line:93%
Is it that difficult to just
talk to me for a second?

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.441 line:93%
Well, it seems to be difficult for you
to spare a second to talk to students.

00:34:24.963 --> 00:34:27.563 line:93%
What do you want me to do, then?

00:34:27.563 --> 00:34:28.825 line:93%
Ugh!

00:34:34.662 --> 00:34:35.778 line:93%
Hey, Choo Geun Deok.

00:34:35.778 --> 00:34:38.130 line:93%
Did you drop off
Ms. Baek well last night?

00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:40.133 line:93%
Ah!

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:42.133 line:93%
Hey!

00:34:42.133 --> 00:34:43.566 line:93%
It's all your fault, Mr. Kang!

00:34:44.907 --> 00:34:46.853 line:93%
And just what is his problem?

00:34:46.853 --> 00:34:49.883 line:93%
I don't know.
He's been like that all day.

00:34:50.898 --> 00:34:53.891 line:93%
Damn it, the school inspector
is coming today, too!

00:35:00.007 --> 00:35:02.275 line:93%
Hey, what's wrong?
Did something happen to you?

00:35:04.153 --> 00:35:06.548 line:93%
Teach! I was looking
all over for you!

00:35:06.963 --> 00:35:08.001 line:93%
Hurry up and go home!

00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:10.007 line:93%
- You little bastard!
- Huh?

00:35:10.007 --> 00:35:11.489 line:93%
- Give that back!
- Whoa!

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.204 line:93%
- Damn it!
- Ow!

00:35:20.061 --> 00:35:22.396 line:93%
I... I got bit.

00:35:22.903 --> 00:35:27.711 line:93%
It's just so vile that I can't
bear to say it with my own mouth.

00:35:28.831 --> 00:35:30.842 line:93%
My first kiss...

00:35:31.766 --> 00:35:33.389 line:93%
Hello, Ms. Baek.

00:35:35.135 --> 00:35:36.987 line:93%
Hey, Choo Gen Deok!

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:42.445 line:93%
Are you going to keep wearing
your name tag improperly like this?

00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:48.655 line:93%
She... doesn't even remember?

00:36:17.512 --> 00:36:19.802 line:93%
Oh, Shin Woo!

00:36:24.081 --> 00:36:27.166 line:93%
They're heavy.
Just sit down.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:41.414 line:93%
Oh man, I would've broken
my back if it hadn't been for you.

00:36:41.414 --> 00:36:42.903 line:93%
Thanks.

00:36:43.684 --> 00:36:45.887 line:93%
But, come to think of it...

00:36:45.887 --> 00:36:48.931 line:93%
I'm always only ever thanking you.

00:36:48.931 --> 00:36:50.586 line:93%
Yesterday was like that, too.

00:36:52.394 --> 00:36:54.063 line:93%
Try saying other things to me, too.

00:36:55.853 --> 00:37:00.499 line:93%
I know you need someone
to lend you an ear right now.

00:37:01.998 --> 00:37:05.744 line:93%
Wow, it's like you read my mind.

00:37:05.744 --> 00:37:07.347 line:93%
It's because of Mr. Kang, right?

00:37:09.416 --> 00:37:10.789 line:93%
Yeah.

00:37:11.264 --> 00:37:15.438 line:93%
I think I make him feel uncomfortable.

00:37:16.804 --> 00:37:19.152 line:93%
I think he's avoiding me.

00:37:21.273 --> 00:37:23.572 line:93%
Maybe you're just imagining it.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.807 line:93%
It's not like he can play
favorites among his students.

00:37:27.807 --> 00:37:29.414 line:93%
Maybe that's what it is.

00:37:30.374 --> 00:37:31.978 line:93%
He's a human being too, after all.

00:37:33.369 --> 00:37:35.088 line:93%
Or it could just be that
he's not in a good mood.

00:37:35.088 --> 00:37:36.362 line:93%
Still.

00:37:37.166 --> 00:37:38.463 line:93%
It makes me worried.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:42.438 line:93%
I'm afraid that Mr. Kang
will hate me now.

00:37:42.438 --> 00:37:45.204 line:93%
It's not like you spoke ill of him,
or harassed him! You just--

00:37:48.043 --> 00:37:50.536 line:93%
said that you liked him,
is all... so...

00:37:50.536 --> 00:37:52.068 line:93%
You really think so?

00:37:56.271 --> 00:37:58.001 line:93%
I acted so cold toward her

00:37:58.001 --> 00:38:00.722 line:93%
and yet I'm wearing the shirt
she gave me as a gift.

00:38:00.722 --> 00:38:03.836 line:93%
Anyone would think that
I'm a complete psycho.

00:38:09.094 --> 00:38:12.369 line:93%
I gave him that shirt yesterday.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.617 line:93%
Hey, so, um, what happened
with this shirt is

00:38:22.617 --> 00:38:25.124 line:93%
the school inspector is coming today,
but Choo Geun Deok--

00:38:25.124 --> 00:38:27.545 line:93%
You must be so happy, Mr. Kang.

00:38:27.545 --> 00:38:30.099 line:93%
You can make her smile
just by wearing a shirt.

00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:33.392 line:93%
Hey, I'm telling you, that's not it.
Listen to me! Hey!

00:38:35.492 --> 00:38:38.961 line:93%
What kind of terrible crime
did I commit in my past life?

00:38:43.066 --> 00:38:49.349 line:93%
183! 184! 185! 186!

00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:55.019 line:93%
He shouldn't have told me to confess
and pretended that he was helping me.

00:38:55.608 --> 00:38:57.536 line:93%
He really threw me for a loop.

00:38:58.079 --> 00:38:59.898 line:93%
Is he messing with me?

00:38:59.898 --> 00:39:04.682 line:93%
- 194! 195!
- 194! 195!

00:39:04.682 --> 00:39:07.304 line:93%
- 196! 197!
- 196! 197!

00:39:07.304 --> 00:39:08.373 line:93%
Raise your arms up high!

00:39:08.373 --> 00:39:09.963 line:93%
- More!
- 198!

00:39:09.963 --> 00:39:11.606 line:93%
- 199!
- 199!

00:39:11.606 --> 00:39:12.693 line:93%
- 200!
- 200!

00:39:12.693 --> 00:39:14.537 line:93%
- Ugh!
- Damn it, please!

00:39:14.537 --> 00:39:17.168 line:93%
I told you not to say the last number.

00:39:17.168 --> 00:39:18.675 line:93%
- Do it again!
- Teach!

00:39:18.675 --> 00:39:20.892 line:93%
Just make that bastard
do it by himself!

00:39:20.892 --> 00:39:23.262 line:93%
It's our second time doing this
because of that bastard!

00:39:23.262 --> 00:39:24.302 line:93%
Hey, shut it.

00:39:24.302 --> 00:39:25.820 line:93%
- Damn it!
- Again!

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:29.128 line:93%
Don't you dare say the last number
again, or I'll kill you.

00:39:29.836 --> 00:39:31.358 line:93%
All right, begin!

00:39:31.358 --> 00:39:38.085 line:93%
- One! Two! Three! Four!
- One! Two! Three! Four!

00:39:38.085 --> 00:39:42.101 line:93%
- Five! Six! Seven!
- Five! Six! Seven!

00:39:42.101 --> 00:39:45.019 line:93%
Because... I like Mr. Kang.

00:39:45.019 --> 00:39:47.735 line:93%
I like you, Mr. Kang.

00:39:48.409 --> 00:39:54.568 line:93%
- 196! 197! 198! 199!
- 196! 197! 198! 199!

00:39:54.568 --> 00:39:55.958 line:93%
200!

00:39:55.958 --> 00:39:56.990 line:93%
- Damn it!
- Damn it!

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:58.775 line:93%
- I ought to kill you!
- 200!

00:39:59.753 --> 00:40:02.371 line:93%
200! I'm the one
who said 200!

00:40:02.371 --> 00:40:03.432 line:93%
Are you out of your damn mind?

00:40:03.432 --> 00:40:04.432 line:93%
Yeah, I am, you bastard!

00:40:04.432 --> 00:40:06.121 line:93%
- What are you going to do about it?
- Hey, what are you doing?

00:40:06.121 --> 00:40:10.516 line:93%
- Hey, stop it, guys.
- Break it up, guys!

00:40:10.516 --> 00:40:12.675 line:93%
- Stop it!
- Stop!

00:40:18.775 --> 00:40:20.920 line:93%
I'll let everyone else go
with your letters of apology.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.586 line:93%
But Kang Shin Woo and Go Sung Jin
will come to school by 5 a.m. tomorrow.

00:40:24.586 --> 00:40:26.322 line:93%
You'll get punished and will have
to volunteer around the school.

00:40:26.322 --> 00:40:27.592 line:93%
Got that?

00:40:29.269 --> 00:40:30.351 line:93%
Answer me!

00:40:30.351 --> 00:40:32.239 line:93%
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:40:32.239 --> 00:40:33.445 line:93%
Go.

00:40:44.458 --> 00:40:47.304 line:93%
I told you to reflect on your actions,
but you rebelled instead?

00:40:52.264 --> 00:40:53.874 line:93%
Hey, Kang Shin Woo.

00:40:53.874 --> 00:40:57.081 line:93%
May I... ask you something?

00:40:58.918 --> 00:41:00.336 line:93%
Why...

00:41:02.132 --> 00:41:03.644 line:93%
did you come here?

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:06.003 line:93%
- What?
- It's a valid question.

00:41:07.353 --> 00:41:11.115 line:93%
It's not like you have family here,
this isn't your hometown.

00:41:11.115 --> 00:41:13.999 line:93%
So why did you come here,
which is in the middle of nowhere

00:41:13.999 --> 00:41:19.425 line:93%
and why do you keep butting
into my business?

00:41:19.425 --> 00:41:21.903 line:93%
I don't understand
any of this, and yet...

00:41:23.876 --> 00:41:25.675 line:93%
all you are doing
is getting in the way.

00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:32.507 line:93%
It's fine.

00:41:33.358 --> 00:41:37.115 line:93%
What would it matter if I knew
the answer to those things now?

00:41:37.115 --> 00:41:39.490 line:93%
It's not like I can turn back time.

00:41:43.307 --> 00:41:45.347 line:93%
I will submit my letter
of apology tomorrow.

00:41:53.447 --> 00:41:55.409 line:93%
I'm the one saying
hurtful things to myself...

00:41:56.617 --> 00:41:58.244 line:93%
and yet it hurts.

I'm getting in the way?

00:42:24.443 --> 00:42:26.545 line:93%
Am I really...

00:42:27.086 --> 00:42:30.306 line:93%
ruining everything
by being here?

<i>I... like you.</i>

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:16.740 line:93%
<i>What's the matter?
Did something happen to you?</i>

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:20.115 line:93%
Because I like... Mr. Kang.

00:43:28.699 --> 00:43:30.358 line:93%
Whatever.

00:43:30.949 --> 00:43:32.494 line:93%
It's...

00:43:33.271 --> 00:43:35.175 line:93%
a losing game, anyway.
