3
00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:45.753
See you later.

4
00:01:03.573 --> 00:01:04.644
Yoon Yi.

5
00:01:05.244 --> 00:01:07.004
- Yes? - Let's go.

6
00:01:07.744 --> 00:01:08.843
Okay.

7
00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:22.994
(If It's a Temporary Parting...)

8
00:01:41.713 --> 00:01:42.813
Does it taste bad?

9
00:01:43.713 --> 00:01:46.914
I searched online for an hour for a good place.

10
00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:50.724
Sorry.

11
00:02:00.323 --> 00:02:01.364
But...

12
00:02:02.463 --> 00:02:04.834
Why do you think that jerk was in our office?

13
00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:08.504
Well, we work for the same parent company.

14
00:02:09.273 --> 00:02:11.904
Anyway, what was his duty in the head office?

15
00:02:12.474 --> 00:02:14.013
Planning and strategy.

16
00:02:20.914 --> 00:02:24.184
Let's not talk about him while we eat.

17
00:02:24.483 --> 00:02:25.654
Let's talk about something else.

18
00:02:27.893 --> 00:02:28.953
Okay.

19
00:02:30.323 --> 00:02:33.423
Is your guest house comfortable?

20
00:02:35.064 --> 00:02:37.164
It's actually Mr. Hwangbo's house.

21
00:02:37.363 --> 00:02:39.104
- Sorry? - He was whining...

22
00:02:39.104 --> 00:02:40.434
that he was lonely,

23
00:02:40.564 --> 00:02:43.233
and it somehow ended up that way.

24
00:02:46.273 --> 00:02:49.974
Did he say why he was lonely?

25
00:02:50.474 --> 00:02:51.513
He said...

26
00:02:53.284 --> 00:02:57.083
that someone he trusted may not be on his side.

27
00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:01.053
I'm sure owners of large corporations...

28
00:03:02.053 --> 00:03:04.224
always live with doubts and suspicions.

29
00:03:05.363 --> 00:03:06.564
Mr. Nam.

30
00:03:08.564 --> 00:03:11.333
When you found out that I was spying for Mr. Cho,

31
00:03:12.464 --> 00:03:16.134
why did you decide to believe me?

32
00:03:16.303 --> 00:03:18.703
Why did you take me back?

33
00:03:22.113 --> 00:03:24.543
I'm repeating what I said to Mr. Hwangbo.

34
00:03:27.654 --> 00:03:28.953
Trusting someone...

35
00:03:29.854 --> 00:03:32.154
means trusting regardless of that.

36
00:03:35.624 --> 00:03:37.464
I wish he would...

37
00:03:38.523 --> 00:03:41.333
trust that person regardless of that.

38
00:04:05.384 --> 00:04:08.854
The person you have reached is unavailable.

39
00:04:09.354 --> 00:04:12.094
Please leave a message after the tone.

40
00:04:13.964 --> 00:04:15.664
Yoon Yi, where are you?

41
00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:19.104
What do I do?

42
00:04:19.104 --> 00:04:21.673
What do I do?

43
00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:24.704
Mr. Hwangbo knows everything.

44
00:04:25.644 --> 00:04:29.144
He knows who I am.

45
00:04:30.214 --> 00:04:31.683
Wang Jung Ae.

46
00:04:45.993 --> 00:04:47.433
Who are you?

47
00:04:54.673 --> 00:04:57.074
Mr. Hwangbo...

48
00:04:57.943 --> 00:04:59.574
Why did you come to me?

49
00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:05.443
There was no reason. I swear.

50
00:05:06.243 --> 00:05:07.383
Liar.

51
00:05:08.613 --> 00:05:11.584
Everything is a lie and fake.

52
00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:15.324
Your name, age, education, and family.

53
00:05:16.654 --> 00:05:17.793
It's all fake.

54
00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:20.764
Why did you lie and approach me?

55
00:05:21.834 --> 00:05:22.964
Was it money for you too?

56
00:05:23.894 --> 00:05:27.404
That's why you acted nice, like you were on my side,

57
00:05:27.803 --> 00:05:29.704
being utterly fake...

58
00:05:31.003 --> 00:05:32.704
and latched yourself onto me.

59
00:05:34.214 --> 00:05:35.414
For money.

60
00:05:36.844 --> 00:05:38.714
That's why you prepared my mom's memorial food...

61
00:05:39.043 --> 00:05:40.784
and comforted me and stuff.

62
00:05:49.024 --> 00:05:50.423
When I was crying,

63
00:05:51.193 --> 00:05:53.164
you must've mocked me on the inside.

64
00:05:55.933 --> 00:05:57.433
I didn't. I swear.

65
00:05:57.563 --> 00:05:59.433
- I didn't. - I thought...

66
00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:02.933
you were different.

67
00:06:03.574 --> 00:06:06.074
I really thought you were on my side.

68
00:06:06.673 --> 00:06:08.313
However, more than the women...

69
00:06:08.474 --> 00:06:10.644
that approach me for my money,

70
00:06:12.243 --> 00:06:13.844
you're worse.

71
00:06:15.654 --> 00:06:16.654
Yes.

72
00:06:17.954 --> 00:06:19.354
You fooled me...

73
00:06:20.423 --> 00:06:21.493
completely.

74
00:06:22.894 --> 00:06:25.824
- Sir, it's not like that. - Let go.

75
00:06:36.503 --> 00:06:37.774
You give me goose bumps.

76
00:07:06.433 --> 00:07:09.774
(Jung Ae)

77
00:07:09.774 --> 00:07:10.803
Jung Ae?

78
00:07:10.803 --> 00:07:14.774
(Jung Ae)

79
00:07:16.414 --> 00:07:17.414
Jung Ae.

80
00:07:26.854 --> 00:07:27.894
Jung Ae.

81
00:07:31.863 --> 00:07:34.493
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

82
00:07:34.834 --> 00:07:37.704
I should have never suggested this.

83
00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:42.173
I must have been crazy.

84
00:07:42.574 --> 00:07:45.974
He asked me if I came for his money.

85
00:07:46.474 --> 00:07:48.214
He says I give him goose bumps.

86
00:07:49.214 --> 00:07:51.084
Even when I tell him that's not true,

87
00:07:51.084 --> 00:07:53.014
he won't listen to me.

88
00:07:53.543 --> 00:07:55.454
What do I do, Yoon Yi?

89
00:07:56.383 --> 00:07:59.524
I don't think I can see his face anymore.

90
00:07:59.623 --> 00:08:01.524
I'm so scared...

91
00:08:01.524 --> 00:08:04.894
Jung Ae, let's keep begging him.

92
00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:08.133
Let's keep begging him until he forgives you.

93
00:08:08.233 --> 00:08:10.293
I want to get out of here.

94
00:08:11.264 --> 00:08:13.933
I don't think I can stay another second.

95
00:08:13.933 --> 00:08:16.133
I can't breathe.

96
00:08:17.404 --> 00:08:21.644
I should have never come to this place.

97
00:08:22.474 --> 00:08:24.644
Yes. Okay.

98
00:08:24.644 --> 00:08:25.683
Let's do that.

99
00:08:26.014 --> 00:08:28.113
Let's do what you want.

100
00:08:29.354 --> 00:08:30.753
Hey, Yoon Yi.

101
00:08:32.024 --> 00:08:33.653
What if Mr. Hwangbo...

102
00:08:33.653 --> 00:08:36.094
fires you because of me?

103
00:08:37.393 --> 00:08:38.393
What?

104
00:08:41.694 --> 00:08:42.834
No.

105
00:08:43.733 --> 00:08:44.934
It's okay.

106
00:08:45.304 --> 00:08:46.434
Don't worry.

107
00:08:49.334 --> 00:08:50.844
It'll all pass.

108
00:09:12.964 --> 00:09:16.493
(Resignation letter, Wang...)

109
00:09:25.844 --> 00:09:26.974
(Resignation letter)

110
00:09:26.974 --> 00:09:30.643
(Wang Jung Ae)

111
00:09:38.584 --> 00:09:40.653
I'm really sorry.

112
00:09:41.794 --> 00:09:43.653
All I can say...

113
00:09:43.893 --> 00:09:47.393
is that I'm sorry.

114
00:09:59.273 --> 00:10:00.604
You don't have to write such things anymore.

115
00:10:00.714 --> 00:10:02.214
Mr. Hwangbo.

116
00:10:04.483 --> 00:10:05.814
Go back to work.

117
00:10:09.883 --> 00:10:10.983
Are you at a hotel?

118
00:10:11.883 --> 00:10:14.094
No, at Director Hwangbo's.

119
00:10:15.094 --> 00:10:18.263
You two somehow get along.

120
00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:21.493
It's only for a few days.

121
00:10:23.094 --> 00:10:25.503
Are you upset to leave Yoon Yi's house?

122
00:10:26.003 --> 00:10:27.503
I get to see her at work.

123
00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:28.633
Exactly.

124
00:10:28.934 --> 00:10:30.944
It's not like you're Altair and Vega...

125
00:10:30.944 --> 00:10:32.674
who only meet once a year.

126
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.913
There is no need to fuss.

127
00:10:35.243 --> 00:10:38.883
You'll get tired of each other if you meet often.

128
00:10:39.714 --> 00:10:42.653
You'll find her more precious...

129
00:10:43.283 --> 00:10:45.253
if you keep a distance.

130
00:10:48.393 --> 00:10:51.324
Would there be another man who gets comforted...

131
00:10:51.324 --> 00:10:52.724
by his ex-father-in-law?

132
00:10:52.724 --> 00:10:53.863
Of course not.

133
00:10:55.094 --> 00:10:57.064
That's why you should be good to me.

134
00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:04.143
Sir, the person in charge of the project team...

135
00:11:04.143 --> 00:11:05.903
came from the head office.

136
00:11:20.084 --> 00:11:22.354
(Senior Managing Director, Bong Jang Woo)

137
00:11:24.194 --> 00:11:26.194
Senior Managing Director Bong Jang Woo?

138
00:11:26.924 --> 00:11:28.393
You said he was...

139
00:11:28.393 --> 00:11:30.094
from the chairman's secretary's office?

140
00:11:30.393 --> 00:11:32.804
- Yes. - He got rid of Yoon Yi.

141
00:11:33.863 --> 00:11:35.974
- Yes. - Wow.

142
00:11:36.273 --> 00:11:38.974
Things are getting really interesting.

143
00:11:39.104 --> 00:11:40.974
The one who has the power of the company merge...

144
00:11:40.974 --> 00:11:42.814
is Yoon Yi's old boss?

145
00:11:43.743 --> 00:11:44.944
This is so much fun.

146
00:11:44.944 --> 00:11:46.184
I'm so excited.

147
00:11:47.243 --> 00:11:50.983
I should make that Mr. Bong work for me.

148
00:11:50.983 --> 00:11:53.153
I'll make him do my work for me.

149
00:11:53.623 --> 00:11:54.993
You just wait, Chi Won.

150
00:11:57.523 --> 00:12:00.594
Right, did the result of the screening come out?

151
00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:01.663
Not yet.

152
00:12:01.964 --> 00:12:04.834
I think the support from their department...

153
00:12:04.834 --> 00:12:06.533
might change the outcome.

154
00:12:06.733 --> 00:12:09.533
Those punks.

155
00:12:09.773 --> 00:12:11.674
Once I become a vice president,

156
00:12:11.743 --> 00:12:13.044
I will split them...

157
00:12:13.044 --> 00:12:17.143
and send them away to different suburbs.

158
00:12:17.714 --> 00:12:18.913
Sir.

159
00:12:20.214 --> 00:12:22.153
Mr. Nam wouldn't...

160
00:12:22.153 --> 00:12:24.684
just sit and watch in such a situation.

161
00:12:25.023 --> 00:12:28.554
Instead of turning his staff against him,

162
00:12:28.554 --> 00:12:30.224
you should recruit them...

163
00:12:30.224 --> 00:12:32.964
and be prepared for emergencies.

164
00:12:32.964 --> 00:12:36.194
That's a great idea.

165
00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:39.064
You should look into it.

166
00:12:40.003 --> 00:12:41.334
Yes, sir.

167
00:12:43.704 --> 00:12:45.604
- From HR? - Yes.

168
00:12:46.444 --> 00:12:48.814
I think they finished the evaluation.

169
00:12:53.613 --> 00:12:54.983
- Let's go together. - No.

170
00:12:56.513 --> 00:12:58.554
They only asked me,

171
00:12:58.554 --> 00:12:59.954
so I'll go alone.

172
00:13:01.054 --> 00:13:02.054
Okay, then.

173
00:13:02.324 --> 00:13:03.694
I'll be back.

174
00:13:28.184 --> 00:13:29.684
- Hello. - Hello.

175
00:13:36.393 --> 00:13:38.594
Is this the video department?

176
00:13:39.224 --> 00:13:41.464
The office is big and clean...

177
00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:43.763
for a department with a romance scandal.

178
00:13:48.403 --> 00:13:50.373
What brings you to our department?

179
00:13:52.143 --> 00:13:53.444
Yoon Yi isn't here?

180
00:14:05.753 --> 00:14:07.184
It's nice.

181
00:14:09.194 --> 00:14:10.694
You're only a managing director,

182
00:14:11.194 --> 00:14:12.424
but your office is huge.

183
00:14:12.993 --> 00:14:14.194
It's a palace.

184
00:14:14.564 --> 00:14:15.564
Isn't it?

185
00:14:17.194 --> 00:14:18.533
You should get to the point.

186
00:14:20.163 --> 00:14:21.174
Oops.

187
00:14:21.773 --> 00:14:23.104
My bad.

188
00:14:24.773 --> 00:14:28.344
Get to the point? My point? My point?

189
00:14:31.013 --> 00:14:32.883
I heard you're planning a show...

190
00:14:32.883 --> 00:14:35.013
that will blow the whistle on the company.

191
00:14:35.714 --> 00:14:37.084
- Yes. - Don't do it.

192
00:14:37.584 --> 00:14:40.023
Our slogan is, "Innovate Ourselves",

193
00:14:40.023 --> 00:14:42.724
but there's no reason to follow it.

194
00:14:43.454 --> 00:14:46.194
The secretary's office finds it very disturbing.

195
00:14:46.194 --> 00:14:48.163
It's not the chairman that's disturbed.

196
00:14:48.163 --> 00:14:50.294
It must be the ones in the secretary's office.

197
00:14:50.294 --> 00:14:51.403
They feel guilty.

198
00:14:51.403 --> 00:14:53.133
I knew you wouldn't get it in one go.

199
00:14:53.133 --> 00:14:54.674
Let me repeat it.

200
00:14:54.674 --> 00:14:56.704
I'll repeat it, okay?

201
00:14:57.444 --> 00:14:59.373
I came here to chop people off.

202
00:14:59.373 --> 00:15:01.373
If you keep your chin up like that,

203
00:15:01.674 --> 00:15:03.314
I might cut your throat.

204
00:15:04.483 --> 00:15:05.643
Are you an executioner?

205
00:15:06.743 --> 00:15:07.883
To cut people's throats?

206
00:15:10.253 --> 00:15:12.724
Our department will prove...

207
00:15:13.253 --> 00:15:14.623
our worth.

208
00:15:16.324 --> 00:15:19.294
Okay, okay. You can try.

209
00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:22.064
However, just remember you don't have much time.

210
00:15:25.533 --> 00:15:28.074
Oh, right.

211
00:15:28.204 --> 00:15:30.033
You said something on the elevator once.

212
00:15:30.133 --> 00:15:32.304
Was it a cartoon song? No, a quote.

213
00:15:32.304 --> 00:15:34.143
Something about dreams of your colleagues?

214
00:15:34.773 --> 00:15:37.944
I'll wait to see how you protect their dreams.

215
00:15:43.954 --> 00:15:45.454
Oh, Mr. Bong.

216
00:15:47.794 --> 00:15:48.794
Take care.

217
00:15:53.464 --> 00:15:55.363
- Why is he here? - Why did he come?

218
00:15:55.363 --> 00:15:56.694
This is strange.

219
00:16:01.204 --> 00:16:02.233
Ms. Jwa.

220
00:16:02.304 --> 00:16:03.974
We decided to transfer you.

221
00:16:04.804 --> 00:16:06.104
Transfer?

222
00:16:07.003 --> 00:16:08.273
Where to?

223
00:16:22.893 --> 00:16:25.064
Did you hear? When are you coming?

224
00:16:26.464 --> 00:16:29.594
After you blamed me for the scandal,

225
00:16:30.363 --> 00:16:31.434
why did you...

226
00:16:32.263 --> 00:16:34.604
request to have me as your assistant?

227
00:16:35.033 --> 00:16:36.733
Because I feel bad.

228
00:16:37.674 --> 00:16:40.143
I felt bad.

229
00:16:40.814 --> 00:16:43.873
What will people say if I hire you again?

230
00:16:45.513 --> 00:16:47.513
"The scandal must have been wrong."

231
00:16:47.913 --> 00:16:51.684
"That's why they're working together."

232
00:16:51.824 --> 00:16:53.184
Am I right?

233
00:16:54.424 --> 00:16:58.094
It was a scandal with me, but it's a fact with him.

234
00:16:59.763 --> 00:17:01.964
Things aren't looking good for him.

235
00:17:01.993 --> 00:17:04.633
It doesn't take much from me...

236
00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:06.234
to make him go away.

237
00:17:08.234 --> 00:17:09.304
What will you do?

238
00:17:10.173 --> 00:17:12.574
Do you want to come and help him stay,

239
00:17:13.244 --> 00:17:15.943
or do you two want to leave together?

240
00:17:17.443 --> 00:17:18.613
Don't want to answer?

241
00:17:21.183 --> 00:17:22.683
You can think about it.

242
00:17:30.693 --> 00:17:31.764
Hey.

243
00:17:32.223 --> 00:17:34.064
That person in charge of reassigning everyone...

244
00:17:34.193 --> 00:17:36.863
is the man who had the rumor with Yoon Yi?

245
00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:38.234
- Yes. - Yes.

246
00:17:40.133 --> 00:17:42.834
I hope it doesn't put us in trouble.

247
00:17:44.473 --> 00:17:47.314
I should have just punched him earlier.

248
00:17:49.613 --> 00:17:52.683
Is it a habit to throw fists at your boss?

249
00:17:53.284 --> 00:17:56.754
They always fire working moms first.

250
00:17:57.354 --> 00:17:59.284
What will I do if I get fired?

251
00:17:59.554 --> 00:18:02.153
Chang Soo and I are in a bigger problem.

252
00:18:02.354 --> 00:18:03.963
They would never renew our contracts.

253
00:18:03.963 --> 00:18:06.064
I won't leave. I won't.

254
00:18:06.324 --> 00:18:07.963
I won't leave without Yoon Yi.

255
00:18:08.064 --> 00:18:10.764
My internship ends at the end of this month.

256
00:18:11.234 --> 00:18:13.633
- What do I do? - At least you're young.

257
00:18:14.504 --> 00:18:17.504
I worked 15 years in the video department.

258
00:18:17.903 --> 00:18:19.804
What if they transfer me?

259
00:18:20.473 --> 00:18:22.844
That would be telling me to resign.

260
00:18:23.514 --> 00:18:25.844
Stop. Don't say it like our team will dismantle.

261
00:18:27.484 --> 00:18:29.453
What's wrong with you guys?

262
00:18:29.653 --> 00:18:31.484
Would it be better...

263
00:18:31.484 --> 00:18:34.354
if we merged with Ad Planning?

264
00:18:34.623 --> 00:18:38.163
Right. Mr. Cho tried to do that a few times.

265
00:18:39.024 --> 00:18:41.963
Although it was tossed when Mr. Nam came along.

266
00:18:59.044 --> 00:19:01.413
No. I won't allow it.

267
00:19:01.584 --> 00:19:04.484
- Sir... - I better talk to them.

268
00:19:05.723 --> 00:19:07.994
No. Don't do it.

269
00:19:08.794 --> 00:19:09.893
Are you saying...

270
00:19:11.064 --> 00:19:13.594
you will work for Mr. Bong?

271
00:19:15.663 --> 00:19:16.734
Yes.

272
00:19:19.804 --> 00:19:22.173
- Yoon Yi. - It's been decided.

273
00:19:22.873 --> 00:19:25.274
You won't be able to change anything.

274
00:19:26.304 --> 00:19:27.473
To me,

275
00:19:28.814 --> 00:19:30.984
it sounds like you don't trust me.

276
00:19:31.084 --> 00:19:32.784
No, I do.

277
00:19:34.754 --> 00:19:37.453
But what will happen if I don't transfer?

278
00:19:37.883 --> 00:19:39.484
How will that solve anything?

279
00:19:39.754 --> 00:19:42.723
Mr. Bong and Mr. Cho will pressure us.

280
00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:44.564
They will try harder to get rid of us.

281
00:19:44.564 --> 00:19:47.594
That's why I told you I'll figure it out!

282
00:19:48.633 --> 00:19:49.734
Mr. Nam.

283
00:19:50.594 --> 00:19:52.604
You said so yourself.

284
00:19:52.963 --> 00:19:54.804
We can't only think of us.

285
00:19:56.203 --> 00:19:57.943
Before you're my boyfriend,

286
00:19:57.943 --> 00:19:59.574
you're the head of this department.

287
00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:02.044
However, will you put the department...

288
00:20:03.314 --> 00:20:05.613
in danger for me?

289
00:20:11.883 --> 00:20:12.984
An assistant is someone...

290
00:20:14.324 --> 00:20:16.653
who suggests an alternative to the boss...

291
00:20:17.123 --> 00:20:19.163
to help him make the right decision.

292
00:20:20.963 --> 00:20:23.834
This is the alternative I'm recommending you.

293
00:20:27.203 --> 00:20:28.633
Please let me...

294
00:20:30.334 --> 00:20:31.673
transfer departments.

295
00:20:36.943 --> 00:20:37.984
It's time for the meeting.

296
00:20:38.613 --> 00:20:40.544
I'm going crazy.

297
00:20:40.913 --> 00:20:42.084
Another meeting?

298
00:20:46.354 --> 00:20:48.094
Gosh.

299
00:20:54.334 --> 00:20:55.794
What are you doing? Come in.

300
00:20:56.264 --> 00:20:57.604
Okay.

301
00:20:58.863 --> 00:21:00.973
We were able to sign with the team.

302
00:21:01.203 --> 00:21:03.004
This time,

303
00:21:03.274 --> 00:21:05.373
I thought we should make a social contribution.

304
00:21:05.403 --> 00:21:07.643
We will look into troubled youths...

305
00:21:07.814 --> 00:21:11.014
who are good at games and support training.

306
00:21:11.413 --> 00:21:13.844
What do you think about coming up...

307
00:21:13.844 --> 00:21:16.084
with a young gaming team?

308
00:21:20.183 --> 00:21:22.623
Is there anything else developed from here?

309
00:21:26.794 --> 00:21:28.994
Mi Ae, this is your idea.

310
00:21:30.764 --> 00:21:32.133
Yes, right.

311
00:21:34.433 --> 00:21:36.673
So...

312
00:21:37.403 --> 00:21:39.703
Aside from gamers,

313
00:21:40.274 --> 00:21:43.544
- the game developers... - Louder.

314
00:21:44.784 --> 00:21:45.844
I can't hear you.

315
00:21:48.054 --> 00:21:50.213
Can't you present your own idea?

316
00:21:54.423 --> 00:21:56.223
Aside from gamers,

317
00:21:57.054 --> 00:21:59.423
the game developers,

318
00:21:59.893 --> 00:22:02.494
graphic designers,

319
00:22:02.764 --> 00:22:04.633
and story writers...

320
00:22:04.933 --> 00:22:07.734
Maybe we can expand in those fields.

321
00:22:08.034 --> 00:22:09.173
It's so banal.

322
00:22:09.604 --> 00:22:12.943
I thought you might have something interesting.

323
00:22:13.703 --> 00:22:15.514
Your ideas are so outdated.

324
00:24:04.084 --> 00:24:12.064
(Whatever it is you want, you'll be able to get it.)

325
00:24:30.844 --> 00:24:32.744
Before you're my boyfriend,

326
00:24:32.943 --> 00:24:34.814
you're the head of this department.

327
00:24:35.514 --> 00:24:37.484
However, will you put the department...

328
00:24:37.484 --> 00:24:39.423
in danger for me?

329
00:24:40.254 --> 00:24:42.094
Would it be better...

330
00:24:42.094 --> 00:24:45.193
if we merged with Ad Planning?

331
00:24:59.044 --> 00:25:00.074
Yes, sir.

332
00:25:00.274 --> 00:25:01.443
Come in.

333
00:25:07.244 --> 00:25:09.883
Did you ask for me?

334
00:25:10.484 --> 00:25:12.024
Let's go on a date today.

335
00:25:31.973 --> 00:25:34.244
- This is yours. - Thank you.

336
00:25:38.883 --> 00:25:39.913
It's good.

337
00:25:41.814 --> 00:25:45.423
Can I have a taste of yours?

338
00:25:47.084 --> 00:25:49.653
You can have it all. It's too cold.

339
00:25:49.754 --> 00:25:52.494
No, just one bite.

340
00:25:52.494 --> 00:25:53.564
No, you can have it all.

341
00:25:54.094 --> 00:25:55.994
Never mind, it's okay.

342
00:26:32.234 --> 00:26:34.074
What's wrong? What is it?

343
00:26:34.104 --> 00:26:35.804
My stomach hurts.

344
00:26:35.903 --> 00:26:36.903
It does?

345
00:26:37.133 --> 00:26:38.504
Why?

346
00:26:38.703 --> 00:26:41.344
I think the ice cream got me sick.

347
00:26:41.713 --> 00:26:44.784
Oh, no. You should've said something before.

348
00:26:46.314 --> 00:26:48.213
Let me use the restroom.

349
00:26:48.213 --> 00:26:50.183
- Stay here. Look around. - Okay.

350
00:26:50.183 --> 00:26:51.784
- I'll be back soon. - Go ahead.

351
00:26:51.784 --> 00:26:52.784
Okay.

352
00:26:54.953 --> 00:26:56.693
You people...

353
00:26:57.223 --> 00:26:59.524
Am I the grim reaper or something?

354
00:26:59.524 --> 00:27:01.933
Why are you avoiding me?

355
00:27:02.294 --> 00:27:03.863
Hey. Come closer!

356
00:27:04.064 --> 00:27:05.604
- Come closer! - Yes, sir.

357
00:27:05.604 --> 00:27:07.203
Good.

358
00:27:07.604 --> 00:27:09.433
I'm a sweet guy...

359
00:27:09.673 --> 00:27:11.244
once you get to know me.

360
00:27:13.044 --> 00:27:14.113
Okay, then.

361
00:27:14.113 --> 00:27:17.074
Let me pour you a drink in order of seniority.

362
00:27:17.213 --> 00:27:19.014
First, Goblin. Here.

363
00:27:20.443 --> 00:27:22.354
This is expensive liquor.

364
00:27:22.554 --> 00:27:24.653
Nam Chi Won doesn't buy things like this, right?

365
00:27:24.723 --> 00:27:26.383
I hear he doesn't even attend company dinners.

366
00:27:26.383 --> 00:27:29.123
That's not true. He does.

367
00:27:29.193 --> 00:27:30.193
Hey.

368
00:27:30.524 --> 00:27:31.524
Gosh.

369
00:27:31.923 --> 00:27:34.463
It's an honor to have you...

370
00:27:35.393 --> 00:27:37.304
pour me a drink.

371
00:27:37.734 --> 00:27:39.564
This is the happiest day of my life.

372
00:27:39.963 --> 00:27:42.873
It must be so hard sending your kids dollars.

373
00:27:43.534 --> 00:27:46.173
Gong Yoo. With the company for 15 years.

374
00:27:46.443 --> 00:27:47.713
Nickname: Rifle.

375
00:27:48.074 --> 00:27:49.514
He never bears the rifle,

376
00:27:49.514 --> 00:27:52.213
and always turns the blame on others.

377
00:27:52.213 --> 00:27:53.613
His family lives abroad.

378
00:27:53.613 --> 00:27:56.183
Family abroad. Gong Yoo. Family abroad.

379
00:27:56.183 --> 00:27:57.524
He looks like a comedian.

380
00:27:58.423 --> 00:27:59.953
Moon Soon Young.

381
00:28:00.284 --> 00:28:01.653
She's been with the company nine years,

382
00:28:01.653 --> 00:28:03.994
and is a working mom raising twins.

383
00:28:04.163 --> 00:28:06.824
It must be hard to work and raise kids.

384
00:28:07.223 --> 00:28:09.433
You're a superwoman.

385
00:28:09.933 --> 00:28:10.933
Thank you.

386
00:28:12.834 --> 00:28:14.274
If the video department...

387
00:28:14.274 --> 00:28:16.834
and Ad Planning merge,

388
00:28:17.234 --> 00:28:19.643
it'll be an advertising video department.

389
00:28:21.143 --> 00:28:22.244
Hey, Gong Yoo.

390
00:28:23.443 --> 00:28:26.314
Shouldn't you be the new leader?

391
00:28:26.913 --> 00:28:29.814
I'll be leaving to become the VP anyway.

392
00:28:30.014 --> 00:28:31.284
Don't you agree, Director Gong?

393
00:28:32.383 --> 00:28:33.994
Director?

394
00:28:34.754 --> 00:28:35.994
Director?

395
00:28:37.524 --> 00:28:38.963
If I could...

396
00:28:42.264 --> 00:28:44.663
I'll devote my all and work like a dog.

397
00:28:45.834 --> 00:28:47.373
You're saying...

398
00:28:47.373 --> 00:28:50.433
our department won't be dissolved then, right?

399
00:28:50.433 --> 00:28:51.943
Of course.

400
00:28:52.373 --> 00:28:54.613
You people have so much value.

401
00:28:54.613 --> 00:28:56.473
We can't lose that.

402
00:28:56.473 --> 00:28:59.613
I'll pull you up into bigger waters,

403
00:29:00.713 --> 00:29:02.713
so let's work together.

404
00:29:07.183 --> 00:29:09.324
Here's to the advertising video department!

405
00:29:09.324 --> 00:29:13.824
- Cheers! - Cheers!

406
00:29:23.004 --> 00:29:25.074
I don't want to say bye.

407
00:29:37.054 --> 00:29:38.054
No.

408
00:29:38.883 --> 00:29:40.084
My key.

409
00:29:56.473 --> 00:29:59.244
You said you need to pack some things.

410
00:29:59.643 --> 00:30:01.074
Go ahead and pack.

411
00:30:04.643 --> 00:30:05.744
Have a seat.

412
00:30:54.863 --> 00:30:55.863
What do you think?

413
00:30:56.633 --> 00:30:57.703
Do you like them?

414
00:31:00.133 --> 00:31:01.703
So this is why...

415
00:31:02.004 --> 00:31:04.373
you took so long in the bathroom earlier.

416
00:31:06.044 --> 00:31:07.244
Are they comfortable?

417
00:31:07.643 --> 00:31:10.913
I asked your cafe friend for your size.

418
00:31:12.683 --> 00:31:14.854
When you buy a woman shoes,

419
00:31:15.383 --> 00:31:17.084
it means you want her to leave.

420
00:31:18.024 --> 00:31:19.223
Are you telling me...

421
00:31:19.883 --> 00:31:21.254
to leave you...

422
00:31:22.393 --> 00:31:23.623
forever?

423
00:31:26.564 --> 00:31:28.433
When you return to being my assistant,

424
00:31:31.834 --> 00:31:33.504
wear these and run to me.

425
00:31:36.133 --> 00:31:37.673
I'll wait until then.

426
00:31:50.314 --> 00:31:51.923
I was trying so hard...

427
00:31:52.284 --> 00:31:54.923
from before not to cry.

428
00:31:55.794 --> 00:31:56.854
Darn it.

429
00:32:04.304 --> 00:32:06.234
Want to know a secret?

430
00:32:08.534 --> 00:32:10.104
That's my handkerchief.

431
00:32:14.544 --> 00:32:15.544
Sorry?

432
00:32:28.568 --> 00:32:33.568
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E14 Jugglers "If It's a Temporary Parting"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

433
00:32:47.344 --> 00:32:49.014
What is this?

434
00:32:55.613 --> 00:32:57.113
Then that was...

435
00:32:58.153 --> 00:32:59.984
I realized after I threw it to you...

436
00:33:01.054 --> 00:33:02.123
that this...

437
00:33:02.423 --> 00:33:04.764
doesn't absorb tears at all.

438
00:33:07.393 --> 00:33:08.734
No wonder.

439
00:33:16.504 --> 00:33:18.373
So, don't cry anymore.

440
00:33:20.203 --> 00:33:21.643
Don't blow your nose.

441
00:33:22.873 --> 00:33:24.244
It was expensive.

442
00:33:29.554 --> 00:33:31.153
I'll wear these shoes...

443
00:33:32.484 --> 00:33:33.953
and return...

444
00:33:35.423 --> 00:33:37.254
to you.

445
00:33:40.024 --> 00:33:41.234
Thank you.

446
00:34:05.054 --> 00:34:07.554
Gosh. Where did they go?

447
00:34:10.893 --> 00:34:12.623
The people who left...

448
00:34:12.823 --> 00:34:14.933
asked me to give this to you.

449
00:34:15.493 --> 00:34:16.493
What?

450
00:34:24.073 --> 00:34:27.544
(5 bites of seafood, 3 shrimp... 32 dollars)

451
00:34:27.973 --> 00:34:31.214
(12 pieces of pork, 4 drinks... 16 dollars)

452
00:34:31.544 --> 00:34:34.654
(12 bites of seafood, 3 drinks... 30 dollars)

453
00:34:35.013 --> 00:34:37.754
(Dieting. Drank only water. 0 dollars)

454
00:34:37.924 --> 00:34:40.384
(1 chili shrimp, 6 spoons of soup... 41 dollars)

455
00:34:40.484 --> 00:34:42.993
(5 pieces of pork, 2 bites of seafood... 11 dollars)

456
00:34:47.334 --> 00:34:49.493
We calculated the cost of every strand...

457
00:34:49.493 --> 00:34:52.004
of noodles we ate and put it in the envelope.

458
00:34:52.004 --> 00:34:55.104
You just have to pay for what you ate.

459
00:34:55.834 --> 00:34:59.303
P.S. We do not drink any alcohol for free...

460
00:34:59.303 --> 00:35:01.643
unless Mr. Nam buys it for us.

461
00:35:07.714 --> 00:35:10.154
Why you video department!

462
00:35:10.154 --> 00:35:13.254
You stinky tofu punks!

463
00:35:13.424 --> 00:35:15.953
- That was awesome! - So cool!

464
00:35:15.953 --> 00:35:17.623
I feel so good.

465
00:35:17.623 --> 00:35:18.893
That felt great!

466
00:35:18.893 --> 00:35:20.223
- Yes! - Great job!

467
00:35:20.223 --> 00:35:21.433
Great job!

468
00:35:26.004 --> 00:35:27.834
Mi Ae, aren't you going home?

469
00:35:28.203 --> 00:35:29.604
Well...

470
00:35:29.604 --> 00:35:33.303
Mr. Hwangbo wanted me to work on some documents,

471
00:35:33.303 --> 00:35:35.044
so I'll go when I'm done.

472
00:35:36.774 --> 00:35:38.544
That isn't urgent.

473
00:35:40.084 --> 00:35:41.084
I mean,

474
00:35:41.553 --> 00:35:43.283
why is he being mean again?

475
00:35:45.854 --> 00:35:46.854
But...

476
00:35:47.623 --> 00:35:50.024
you can't quit, okay? Promise?

477
00:35:53.924 --> 00:35:55.194
Good night.

478
00:35:55.433 --> 00:35:57.604
Okay. Work hard.

479
00:35:57.864 --> 00:35:58.864
I will.

480
00:36:22.924 --> 00:36:25.393
What? Why?

481
00:36:26.663 --> 00:36:28.194
I'm not the bad one.

482
00:36:29.294 --> 00:36:31.134
Ms. Wang lied to me first.

483
00:36:46.944 --> 00:36:49.114
Has your depression worsened that badly,

484
00:36:49.614 --> 00:36:51.384
that you talk to a doll?

485
00:37:06.564 --> 00:37:08.473
Maybe I shouldn't have bought her shoes.

486
00:37:09.604 --> 00:37:11.444
What if she never comes back?

487
00:37:12.803 --> 00:37:14.643
I should've fed her at least.

488
00:37:15.473 --> 00:37:17.984
It's not nice to starve someone.

489
00:37:18.413 --> 00:37:20.013
Whom did you not feed?

490
00:37:20.214 --> 00:37:22.314
For whom did you buy shoes?

491
00:37:23.783 --> 00:37:25.884
I asked first.

492
00:37:30.924 --> 00:37:32.263
Ms. Wang.

493
00:37:36.834 --> 00:37:38.303
The person you wanted to trust,

494
00:37:39.364 --> 00:37:42.134
but couldn't was your assistant?

495
00:37:43.004 --> 00:37:44.073
Yes.

496
00:37:45.004 --> 00:37:46.444
She lied to me.

497
00:37:48.473 --> 00:37:49.643
Are you angry?

498
00:37:49.643 --> 00:37:51.384
Of course, I am.

499
00:37:52.114 --> 00:37:53.584
She lied to me.

500
00:37:54.484 --> 00:37:56.513
She made a fool of me with that fake...

501
00:37:57.013 --> 00:37:58.384
naive face.

502
00:38:03.323 --> 00:38:05.663
I must've lost my eye for judgment.

503
00:38:10.663 --> 00:38:13.134
So, exactly what is it...

504
00:38:14.203 --> 00:38:15.473
that you feel?

505
00:38:17.104 --> 00:38:19.703
Is it a sense of loss for losing...

506
00:38:19.873 --> 00:38:21.973
a colleague that you had trusted, or...

507
00:38:23.373 --> 00:38:25.814
anger for being betrayed by the woman you liked?

508
00:38:29.413 --> 00:38:30.654
So, I think...

509
00:38:31.183 --> 00:38:33.453
a sense of loss is stronger. No.

510
00:38:33.884 --> 00:38:36.893
Betrayal seems to be stronger...

511
00:38:37.424 --> 00:38:38.424
No.

512
00:38:39.393 --> 00:38:40.933
Maybe it's both.

513
00:38:41.493 --> 00:38:43.134
Whatever. Whatever.

514
00:38:43.493 --> 00:38:45.364
You can't categorize feelings...

515
00:38:45.433 --> 00:38:47.634
into boxes, like...

516
00:38:47.734 --> 00:38:49.904
red or blue, square or round!

517
00:38:52.743 --> 00:38:53.873
What was that?

518
00:38:58.114 --> 00:39:00.283
If you don't know how you feel, who would?

519
00:39:13.364 --> 00:39:16.263
He's just a kid, so he didn't know better.

520
00:39:17.533 --> 00:39:19.203
- What happened? - Hey.

521
00:39:19.763 --> 00:39:22.604
A cop caught him making deliveries on a bike.

522
00:39:24.743 --> 00:39:27.373
Deliveries? Why?

523
00:39:29.343 --> 00:39:32.814
I'm going to drop out of school and make money.

524
00:39:36.254 --> 00:39:38.053
- You brat! - Jung Ae!

525
00:39:38.283 --> 00:39:39.924
Who said to make money?

526
00:39:40.323 --> 00:39:42.123
Who said to do this?

527
00:39:43.294 --> 00:39:45.464
Why do you keep breaking my heart?

528
00:39:46.263 --> 00:39:49.134
Why are you making it so hard on me too?

529
00:39:51.104 --> 00:39:54.203
Please let me breathe a little!

530
00:39:54.973 --> 00:39:57.373
- I can't take this. - Jung Ae!

531
00:40:00.714 --> 00:40:02.814
Jung Ae!

532
00:40:12.183 --> 00:40:15.323
Don't give me that innocent look.

533
00:40:16.593 --> 00:40:19.493
Jung Ae, I'm really sick of this.

534
00:40:21.364 --> 00:40:23.234
That's why you acted nice, like you were on my side,

535
00:40:23.364 --> 00:40:25.033
being utterly fake...

536
00:40:25.033 --> 00:40:26.734
and latched yourself onto me.

537
00:40:27.703 --> 00:40:29.004
For money.

538
00:40:29.604 --> 00:40:31.044
You make me sick.

539
00:40:51.924 --> 00:40:53.694
When you return to being my assistant,

540
00:40:56.033 --> 00:40:57.634
wear these and run to me.

541
00:41:14.254 --> 00:41:15.484
Hi, Gun Woo.

542
00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:35.174
Who is this?

543
00:41:38.774 --> 00:41:39.873
Hello?

544
00:41:40.174 --> 00:41:41.274
Hello?

545
00:41:42.174 --> 00:41:43.814
Is my aunt...

546
00:41:45.183 --> 00:41:47.584
with you, by any chance?

547
00:41:48.214 --> 00:41:49.283
What?

548
00:41:55.723 --> 00:41:56.854
Hey.

549
00:41:58.163 --> 00:42:01.093
My aunt isn't back yet.

550
00:42:01.163 --> 00:42:02.564
What's wrong with you?

551
00:42:03.194 --> 00:42:05.803
Why are you referring to your mom as your aunt?

552
00:42:06.404 --> 00:42:07.734
You knew?

553
00:42:10.373 --> 00:42:11.504
That's right.

554
00:42:12.174 --> 00:42:13.243
Then...

555
00:42:14.743 --> 00:42:16.274
do you know about my dad...

556
00:42:17.343 --> 00:42:18.413
What?

557
00:42:22.683 --> 00:42:25.683
After my dad left us like that,

558
00:42:28.024 --> 00:42:29.093
my mom...

559
00:42:30.424 --> 00:42:31.823
had no choice, but to...

560
00:42:37.834 --> 00:42:39.504
You haven't heard from her yet, have you?

561
00:42:39.703 --> 00:42:41.033
Where could he have gone?

562
00:42:41.303 --> 00:42:44.203
She's always at the office or at home.

563
00:42:45.873 --> 00:42:47.614
I'll check the office.

564
00:42:47.614 --> 00:42:50.413
No. I'll go. Taxi! Taxi!

565
00:43:36.794 --> 00:43:37.964
This is where you came?

566
00:43:47.973 --> 00:43:49.674
Why are you always the victim?

567
00:43:50.973 --> 00:43:52.904
Why do you always take it?

568
00:43:54.044 --> 00:43:57.243
If it's hard, say so. If you're hurting, say so.

569
00:43:58.283 --> 00:44:00.343
Scream and get angry.

570
00:44:02.254 --> 00:44:04.384
Because if I can put up with it,

571
00:44:05.984 --> 00:44:08.123
everything becomes okay.

572
00:44:19.834 --> 00:44:20.904
But you...

573
00:44:22.134 --> 00:44:23.533
aren't okay.

574
00:44:24.604 --> 00:44:26.303
You're hurt.

575
00:44:36.314 --> 00:44:37.384
Ms. Wang.

576
00:44:38.623 --> 00:44:40.154
If it's too hard for you,

577
00:44:41.223 --> 00:44:42.854
take a break from work.

578
00:44:44.864 --> 00:44:46.024
And...

579
00:44:47.493 --> 00:44:48.864
come back.

580
00:44:50.194 --> 00:44:52.104
Not as Wang Mi Ae,

581
00:44:53.464 --> 00:44:54.774
but as Wang Jung Ae.

582
00:45:41.314 --> 00:45:42.384
Chi Won.

583
00:45:44.323 --> 00:45:46.524
Hating a person...

584
00:45:48.354 --> 00:45:50.223
is really hard to do.

585
00:45:52.093 --> 00:45:53.323
So,

586
00:45:55.093 --> 00:45:56.763
I decided not to hate.

587
00:46:07.044 --> 00:46:09.073
If you're not going to talk at all,

588
00:46:09.314 --> 00:46:11.143
at least play some music.

589
00:46:33.303 --> 00:46:34.303
Hey, friend.

590
00:46:34.573 --> 00:46:36.834
Whom are you talking to? Me?

591
00:46:36.834 --> 00:46:37.843
Yes?

592
00:46:38.044 --> 00:46:40.774
Play Nell's "Time Spent Walking Through Memories".

593
00:46:41.013 --> 00:46:43.774
Playing Nell's "Time Spent Walking Through Memories".

594
00:48:20.544 --> 00:48:21.544
Yes?

595
00:48:34.854 --> 00:48:35.924
Sir.

596
00:48:38.294 --> 00:48:39.663
Here you go.

597
00:48:40.834 --> 00:48:41.864
I don't drink...

598
00:48:42.334 --> 00:48:44.064
sweet drinks anymore.

599
00:48:46.734 --> 00:48:48.533
I understand...

600
00:48:49.004 --> 00:48:50.904
why you hate me.

601
00:48:52.843 --> 00:48:55.073
I know I deserve it.

602
00:48:58.283 --> 00:48:59.884
I'm sorry.

603
00:49:02.654 --> 00:49:03.654
Also,

604
00:49:04.384 --> 00:49:07.354
thank you for finding Jung Ae...

605
00:49:07.893 --> 00:49:09.154
yesterday.

606
00:49:10.393 --> 00:49:11.964
And I know...

607
00:49:13.623 --> 00:49:15.194
I'm shameless, but...

608
00:49:15.993 --> 00:49:17.663
please take good care of Mr. Nam.

609
00:49:23.473 --> 00:49:25.073
Wait. Hey.

610
00:49:28.843 --> 00:49:30.573
Well... So...

611
00:49:32.214 --> 00:49:33.343
If you're worried,

612
00:49:34.413 --> 00:49:35.553
you can...

613
00:49:36.214 --> 00:49:37.723
come over to my place.

614
00:49:53.703 --> 00:49:54.873
But...

615
00:49:54.873 --> 00:49:57.703
How could they take you?

616
00:50:00.373 --> 00:50:01.873
Don't cry.

617
00:50:02.473 --> 00:50:04.683
She'll be in the same building.

618
00:50:06.643 --> 00:50:08.154
You'll visit often, right?

619
00:50:09.384 --> 00:50:11.854
An assistant can't leave her desk.

620
00:50:12.323 --> 00:50:14.294
It'll be hard to see her.

621
00:50:15.694 --> 00:50:17.024
I'm so sad.

622
00:50:22.033 --> 00:50:24.433
Where's Chang Soo?

623
00:50:44.053 --> 00:50:45.053
But...

624
00:50:45.254 --> 00:50:46.754
where's Mr. Nam?

625
00:50:46.953 --> 00:50:49.194
I think he went out on purpose.

626
00:50:49.754 --> 00:50:52.364
Gosh. I'm sure he's upset.

627
00:50:55.263 --> 00:50:56.263
Okay.

628
00:50:56.564 --> 00:50:58.433
I'll get going now.

629
00:50:59.604 --> 00:51:01.004
I'll visit often.

630
00:51:03.473 --> 00:51:05.073
You have to visit often.

631
00:51:05.073 --> 00:51:06.104
Okay.

632
00:51:08.214 --> 00:51:09.643
Bye.

633
00:51:45.814 --> 00:51:46.984
Mr. Nam.

634
00:51:47.084 --> 00:51:48.584
You can't go without seeing me.

635
00:52:02.533 --> 00:52:04.134
I knew it.

636
00:52:06.604 --> 00:52:08.573
You promised not to cry.

637
00:52:09.703 --> 00:52:10.973
I will...

638
00:52:12.803 --> 00:52:14.314
bring you back.

639
00:52:14.944 --> 00:52:17.544
- So, until then... - I'll be myself,

640
00:52:18.984 --> 00:52:21.254
smile a lot, eat well,

641
00:52:21.783 --> 00:52:23.484
work hard,

642
00:52:23.953 --> 00:52:25.683
and hang in there.

643
00:52:26.223 --> 00:52:27.254
So,

644
00:52:27.893 --> 00:52:30.154
don't make me wait for too long.

645
00:52:31.993 --> 00:52:34.864
Please protect our department.

646
00:53:01.723 --> 00:53:02.754
It has been...

647
00:53:04.263 --> 00:53:05.893
a pleasure,

648
00:53:07.864 --> 00:53:09.564
Mr. Nam Chi Won.

649
00:53:29.714 --> 00:53:32.553
What about the unfair work distribution?

650
00:53:32.553 --> 00:53:34.424
Looking at the bids over the past three years,

651
00:53:34.424 --> 00:53:35.924
American Pictures,

652
00:53:35.924 --> 00:53:38.263
owned by Park Soon Taek, won 14.

653
00:53:38.263 --> 00:53:40.194
Alpha Pictures, for which Park Soon Taek...

654
00:53:40.194 --> 00:53:42.194
is the actual owner, won 12.

655
00:53:42.194 --> 00:53:44.064
They alternated.

656
00:53:44.464 --> 00:53:46.933
Mr. Park. Question those in charge of the bids,

657
00:53:46.933 --> 00:53:49.334
and find the relationship with Ad Planning.

658
00:53:49.334 --> 00:53:50.404
Yes, sir.

659
00:53:50.404 --> 00:53:52.473
I'll check the production companies that made...

660
00:53:52.473 --> 00:53:54.013
the finals in the recent bid.

661
00:53:54.013 --> 00:53:56.913
I'll see if there was foul play during the bidding.

662
00:53:56.913 --> 00:53:59.843
Seeing how they managed to evade the annual audit,

663
00:53:59.843 --> 00:54:01.183
it may be difficult...

664
00:54:01.183 --> 00:54:03.013
to find any hard evidence.

665
00:54:06.553 --> 00:54:07.993
But don't give up.

666
00:54:08.524 --> 00:54:09.953
Let's fight all the way.

667
00:54:11.364 --> 00:54:14.263
What do you mean, you won't bid?

668
00:54:14.263 --> 00:54:15.364
You can't...

669
00:54:15.364 --> 00:54:17.064
That Nam Chi Won guy...

670
00:54:17.064 --> 00:54:19.404
Don't you know his rep from his newsroom days?

671
00:54:19.834 --> 00:54:22.004
If he finds anything on us,

672
00:54:23.533 --> 00:54:24.544
he may find out...

673
00:54:25.004 --> 00:54:27.004
about the price fixing and rebates...

674
00:54:27.004 --> 00:54:28.073
Hey.

675
00:54:29.073 --> 00:54:30.314
Is there proof?

676
00:54:30.314 --> 00:54:33.643
We made sure there wouldn't be a problem.

677
00:54:34.683 --> 00:54:36.084
Don't worry,

678
00:54:36.654 --> 00:54:38.424
and trust me, okay?

679
00:54:51.033 --> 00:54:52.064
Yes, sir.

680
00:54:52.663 --> 00:54:55.734
Schedule a meeting with Bong Jang Woo.

681
00:54:57.444 --> 00:54:58.774
Yes, sir.

682
00:55:21.834 --> 00:55:22.834
Hello?

683
00:55:25.533 --> 00:55:26.533
Yes, sir.

684
00:55:37.073 --> 00:55:40.243
I just sent you a text.

685
00:55:45.053 --> 00:55:46.924
Buy that for me tonight.

686
00:55:47.493 --> 00:55:48.623
In red.

687
00:55:51.364 --> 00:55:52.364
What?

688
00:55:53.323 --> 00:55:54.993
You always did it before.

689
00:55:56.634 --> 00:55:59.163
Yes, sir. I will.

690
00:56:07.243 --> 00:56:11.013
That rat. He will never change.

691
00:56:13.544 --> 00:56:15.683
Nam Chi Won's office...

692
00:56:17.623 --> 00:56:20.694
I'm sorry. Bong Jang Woo's office.

693
00:56:22.294 --> 00:56:23.323
It's me.

694
00:56:24.263 --> 00:56:25.294
Hey.

695
00:56:25.393 --> 00:56:29.033
My boss wants to have tea with Mr. Bong.

696
00:56:29.893 --> 00:56:31.433
Is he free this afternoon?

697
00:56:32.134 --> 00:56:33.933
Just a minute.

698
00:56:36.873 --> 00:56:39.944
You look even better than when I last saw you...

699
00:56:39.944 --> 00:56:41.373
at the BBA.

700
00:56:41.444 --> 00:56:44.283
Your face is just glowing.

701
00:56:44.944 --> 00:56:46.843
It's thanks to my aesthetician.

702
00:56:47.243 --> 00:56:49.183
Even men get facials these days.

703
00:56:49.283 --> 00:56:50.584
That's right.

704
00:56:50.953 --> 00:56:54.424
Why don't we go together sometime?

705
00:56:55.953 --> 00:56:58.663
Bring some cold water to wake him right up.

706
00:56:58.794 --> 00:57:00.364
Put in lots of ice.

707
00:57:00.663 --> 00:57:01.794
Bring it in.

708
00:57:07.734 --> 00:57:10.334
I was burning up inside.

709
00:57:10.473 --> 00:57:11.904
You're so thoughtful.

710
00:57:16.373 --> 00:57:19.683
Shoot. That's all the ice we have. Darn it.

711
00:57:38.134 --> 00:57:40.933
If you look at the work that overlaps,

712
00:57:41.174 --> 00:57:44.904
it proves that Ad Planning can easily handle...

713
00:57:44.904 --> 00:57:46.843
the video department's work.

714
00:57:48.714 --> 00:57:51.884
Sure. Intra-company news can be outsourced,

715
00:57:52.084 --> 00:57:54.314
or sent to each subsidiary's PR team.

716
00:57:55.013 --> 00:57:57.354
That's much more efficient for the group.

717
00:57:57.584 --> 00:57:58.723
Right?

718
00:58:01.823 --> 00:58:03.024
Exactly.

719
00:58:03.723 --> 00:58:06.064
We really get each other.

720
00:58:06.064 --> 00:58:08.464
We're on the same wavelength. Right?

721
00:58:09.433 --> 00:58:10.533
What?

722
00:58:11.134 --> 00:58:12.303
What?

723
00:58:12.904 --> 00:58:15.573
What was that? Are you speaking down to me?

724
00:58:16.404 --> 00:58:18.573
No, sir. I said, "sir."

725
00:58:18.973 --> 00:58:20.913
I said, "Right, sir?"

726
00:58:24.783 --> 00:58:25.843
Hey.

727
00:58:29.683 --> 00:58:32.424
You were promoted from an MD's assistant...

728
00:58:32.424 --> 00:58:34.053
to a Senior MD's assistant instantly.

729
00:58:34.254 --> 00:58:35.254
Congratulations.

730
00:58:48.604 --> 00:58:50.303
That's refreshing.

731
00:59:00.243 --> 00:59:02.453
It's waking me right up.

732
00:59:06.453 --> 00:59:08.854
I'll let you two talk.

733
00:59:18.303 --> 00:59:19.834
That feels good.

734
00:59:34.314 --> 00:59:36.783
Here's the handout for the executives meeting.

735
00:59:36.783 --> 00:59:37.854
Thank you.

736
00:59:38.053 --> 00:59:39.984
Should I go with you? No?

737
00:59:40.154 --> 00:59:42.123
I guess I shouldn't, right?

738
00:59:42.953 --> 00:59:44.163
Good luck!

739
01:00:30.073 --> 01:00:31.703
Today, Bong Jang Woo,

740
01:00:32.073 --> 01:00:35.114
who is in charge of reorganization,

741
01:00:35.743 --> 01:00:37.484
will announce a few things...

742
01:00:37.743 --> 01:00:39.944
about the reorganization.

743
01:00:40.044 --> 01:00:41.053
Mr. Bong.

744
01:00:41.114 --> 01:00:43.484
Hello. I'm Bong Jang Woo.

745
01:00:43.814 --> 01:00:45.984
There are some familiar faces.

746
01:00:46.453 --> 01:00:47.694
It's good to see you.

747
01:00:48.993 --> 01:00:52.564
Since this is a group-wide process, YB Ads...

748
01:00:53.364 --> 01:00:55.734
will also undergo reorganization.

749
01:00:56.533 --> 01:00:57.763
Please hand these out.

750
01:01:01.004 --> 01:01:03.973
The departments being considered...

751
01:01:04.143 --> 01:01:05.743
for reorganization are as follows.

752
01:01:06.643 --> 01:01:08.643
Okay. To start off,

753
01:01:09.743 --> 01:01:12.843
Digital Marketing, Promotion,

754
01:01:13.314 --> 01:01:14.614
Finance two,

755
01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:16.484
and Accounting two.

756
01:01:18.754 --> 01:01:20.854
And finally, the department...

757
01:01:21.424 --> 01:01:23.294
being considered for dissolution...

758
01:01:25.093 --> 01:01:26.524
is the video department.

759
01:01:43.314 --> 01:01:46.683
Raise them well. Don't let any of them die.

760
01:01:47.984 --> 01:01:49.453
I'll check.

761
01:01:50.953 --> 01:01:53.084
You said they grow on their own...

762
01:01:53.384 --> 01:01:54.453
even if I do nothing.

763
01:01:56.354 --> 01:01:57.524
I was lying.

764
01:01:58.223 --> 01:02:00.834
Cacti are the hardest to grow...

765
01:02:01.093 --> 01:02:02.694
because they're so sensitive.

766
01:02:03.064 --> 01:02:06.303
Just like you.

767
01:02:06.504 --> 01:02:07.604
Me?

768
01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:08.973
Yes.

769
01:02:09.473 --> 01:02:12.004
You are all prickly as if you reject...

770
01:02:12.004 --> 01:02:13.904
all interest and interference,

771
01:02:13.904 --> 01:02:16.973
but if the sunlight and water are slightly off,

772
01:02:17.174 --> 01:02:19.814
you get all weak.

773
01:02:22.154 --> 01:02:24.584
Do you know the cactus flower meaning?

774
01:02:26.683 --> 01:02:27.794
What is it?

775
01:02:31.663 --> 01:02:33.093
Passionate love.

776
01:02:34.864 --> 01:02:36.064
How unfitting.

777
01:02:37.634 --> 01:02:38.734
Right?

778
01:02:40.774 --> 01:02:42.973
That's why it's just like you.

779
01:03:10.904 --> 01:03:16.033
(Need attention and love to grow.)
