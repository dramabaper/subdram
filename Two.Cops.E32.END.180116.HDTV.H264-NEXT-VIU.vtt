00:00:21.596 --> 00:00:24.336
(Final Episode)

2
00:00:46.556 --> 00:00:47.755
Wait.

3
00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:57.236
Are you looking for this?

4
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.935
Bring that lighter first.

5
00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:24.895
You got your stuff now. I want my friend back.

6
00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:27.966
Your friend?

7
00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:31.495
I heard he's a conman.

8
00:01:31.495 --> 00:01:34.736
What's so bad about a conman? I'm much better than a murderer.

9
00:01:35.335 --> 00:01:36.805
Did you get rid of him?

10
00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:44.676
This is... This isn't what you promised.

11
00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:49.115
Your expertise is...

12
00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:52.516
covering up something with another, getting more dangerous as you go.

13
00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:58.255
Why was it so hard for this little thing to come to me?

14
00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:01.266
You're right.

15
00:02:02.126 --> 00:02:03.895
I turned a blind eye...

16
00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:06.665
to Chairman Jo's corruption just once when I was a detective.

17
00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:09.366
After I became a prosecutor,

18
00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:13.175
Chairman Jo helped me out.

19
00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:15.876
This is it. Detective Song's story.

20
00:02:18.376 --> 00:02:19.945
That's how you made that corrupt detective.

21
00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:23.786
What did you do with Detective Song?

22
00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:31.855
I don't want to be an embarrassment to Ji An.

23
00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:34.626
Jung Hwan, I'm sorry.

24
00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:37.896
Those two kids worked so hard...

25
00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:40.195
to find this evidence.

26
00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:42.005
I'm going to turn it in.

27
00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:45.836
Jung Hwan!

28
00:03:26.746 --> 00:03:28.545
That's how I pushed him over.

29
00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:31.355
I did that on an impulse,

30
00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:33.216
but I don't regret doing so.

31
00:03:34.686 --> 00:03:36.626
If I didn't stop Ji Seok,

32
00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:40.866
I wouldn't...

33
00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:42.665
be sitting here at this moment.

34
00:03:43.096 --> 00:03:44.135
Okay.

35
00:03:44.566 --> 00:03:45.866
Are we done now?

36
00:03:59.415 --> 00:04:00.786
If I give you the money,

37
00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:03.445
you won't tell anyone about...

38
00:04:03.646 --> 00:04:05.255
killing...

39
00:04:08.925 --> 00:04:09.985
To be honest,

40
00:04:10.755 --> 00:04:13.026
you can't hear the important parts.

41
00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:18.266
I'm going to make him confess.

42
00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:19.435
Confess?

43
00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:21.636
Okay, let's say that he did that.

44
00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:23.865
But it's hard to record that on video or in audio.

45
00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:26.435
And Kim Jong Doo already got him once.

46
00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:27.576
Yes.

47
00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:28.946
That's the problem.

48
00:04:28.946 --> 00:04:30.475
He may be fooled once, but not twice.

49
00:04:31.315 --> 00:04:33.216
Captain Yoo, you know nothing about fraud.

50
00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:34.685
Someone who's been fooled once...

51
00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:36.946
can be fooled twice.

52
00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:38.716
Someone who's been fooled once...

53
00:04:40.086 --> 00:04:41.725
can be fooled twice.

54
00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:44.625
Are you looking for this?

55
00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:46.596
Bring that lighter first.

56
00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:52.536
We have to make him confess with the lighter in his hand.

57
00:04:52.536 --> 00:04:54.506
That's how I pushed him over.

58
00:04:55.406 --> 00:04:57.276
I did it on an impulse,

59
00:04:57.935 --> 00:04:59.475
but I don't regret it.

60
00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:05.016
- On that lighter... - The tiny camera.

61
00:05:05.016 --> 00:05:06.545
- On that side. - Here?

62
00:05:08.286 --> 00:05:09.346
How about here?

63
00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:11.985
It's done. Look through this end.

64
00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:16.826
We'll add one more secret function.

65
00:05:17.495 --> 00:05:19.125
A secret camera.

66
00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:31.006
Who do you think received...

67
00:05:32.235 --> 00:05:33.605
the footage from that camera?

68
00:05:38.146 --> 00:05:42.586
Why was it so hard for this little thing to come to me?

69
00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:45.355
I turned a blind eye to Chairman Jo's corruption.

70
00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:46.656
- That's it! - We got it!

71
00:05:46.656 --> 00:05:50.256
- We got him this time! - After I became a prosecutor...

72
00:05:50.256 --> 00:05:51.995
We got you this time.

73
00:05:52.156 --> 00:05:56.425
(Video mail)

74
00:05:57.235 --> 00:06:00.266
That's how I pushed him over.

75
00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:02.435
- I did it on an impulse. - Who's this?

76
00:06:02.435 --> 00:06:04.175
- But I don't regret it. - It's Tak Jung Hwan.

77
00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:07.506
If I didn't stop Ji Seok,

78
00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:09.946
I wouldn't be sitting here at this moment.

79
00:06:10.446 --> 00:06:11.516
Hey.

80
00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:14.485
It's all over now.

81
00:06:15.346 --> 00:06:18.216
That lighter just captured you...

82
00:06:18.915 --> 00:06:20.355
admitting to everything.

83
00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:22.855
You die.

84
00:06:31.365 --> 00:06:32.665
Watch the news.

85
00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:43.006
We have a newsflash.

86
00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:44.946
We just received a video of...

87
00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:48.216
Director Tak Jung Hwan who was going to be appointed...

88
00:06:48.216 --> 00:06:49.646
Minister of Justice admitting to murder.

89
00:06:49.646 --> 00:06:50.985
Here it is.

90
00:06:50.985 --> 00:06:52.055
(Tak Jung Hwan)

91
00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:56.526
Why was it so hard for this little thing to come to me?

92
00:06:56.526 --> 00:06:58.526
That's how I pushed him over.

93
00:06:58.896 --> 00:07:01.096
I did it on an impulse,

94
00:07:01.795 --> 00:07:03.596
but I don't regret it.

95
00:07:03.865 --> 00:07:06.466
If I didn't stop Ji Seok,

96
00:07:06.865 --> 00:07:08.906
I wouldn't be sitting here at this moment.

97
00:07:09.036 --> 00:07:11.406
This video is a confession stating that...

98
00:07:11.406 --> 00:07:14.276
he killed Detective Song Ji Seok 16 years ago.

99
00:07:14.276 --> 00:07:16.006
We believe this will create...

100
00:07:16.006 --> 00:07:18.716
huge ripples in the legal and political community.

101
00:07:18.716 --> 00:07:19.875
It was believed that...

102
00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:23.286
Song Ji Seok was corrupt and had killed himself.

103
00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:26.315
In reality, he had been murdered by Tak Jung Hwan.

104
00:07:26.315 --> 00:07:30.425
It was made to look like a suicide, and the corruption charges faked.

105
00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:35.865
Detective Song Ji Seok...

106
00:07:38.266 --> 00:07:42.036
Detective Song Ji Seok was my father.

107
00:07:42.706 --> 00:07:47.136
I am pleased to be able to report the truth about his death.

108
00:07:54.545 --> 00:07:56.115
It's all over.

109
00:07:57.115 --> 00:07:58.586
No.

110
00:07:59.216 --> 00:08:01.156
How far will you go?

111
00:08:03.286 --> 00:08:06.495
Can I ask you for a favor?

112
00:08:12.536 --> 00:08:13.795
Soo A.

113
00:08:15.266 --> 00:08:16.636
For the last time,

114
00:08:18.406 --> 00:08:22.105
can I ask you for a favor?

115
00:08:32.256 --> 00:08:33.786
Director Tak.

116
00:08:34.455 --> 00:08:36.585
If you want me dead, do it yourself.

117
00:08:36.585 --> 00:08:39.496
Did you ever wonder...

118
00:08:39.496 --> 00:08:42.325
why Tak Jung Hwan never did it himself?

119
00:08:42.496 --> 00:08:44.795
Why he always made you kill?

120
00:08:45.165 --> 00:08:46.335
I'm meant to do...

121
00:08:47.195 --> 00:08:49.465
great things for our country.

122
00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:53.036
She can do things like that.

123
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:56.146
That's what she was born to do.

124
00:08:57.715 --> 00:08:59.415
That son of a gun.

125
00:09:05.756 --> 00:09:07.256
Now, do you see?

126
00:09:07.486 --> 00:09:09.856
What the man you were...

127
00:09:10.486 --> 00:09:12.996
so loyal to made you do?

128
00:09:13.295 --> 00:09:14.695
Soo A.

129
00:09:15.866 --> 00:09:17.665
Do as I say.

130
00:09:18.695 --> 00:09:20.065
Just once more.

131
00:09:21.906 --> 00:09:25.536
Can I ask you for a favor?

132
00:09:31.016 --> 00:09:32.545
No.

133
00:09:52.835 --> 00:09:53.935
Why?

134
00:09:54.366 --> 00:09:56.036
Why did you...

135
00:09:58.075 --> 00:09:59.476
stab yourself?

136
00:10:00.675 --> 00:10:02.776
Soo A. Soo A.

137
00:10:02.976 --> 00:10:04.045
Soo A!

138
00:10:04.045 --> 00:10:06.545
- What... - Get an ambulance.

139
00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:08.315
Get an ambulance!

140
00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:10.986
- Soo A! - The jerk.

141
00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:14.685
I feel sorry and guilty toward the people...

142
00:10:15.626 --> 00:10:17.126
who died because of me.

143
00:10:18.795 --> 00:10:21.425
Jin Soo A. I think...

144
00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:24.396
she might come around.

145
00:10:30.465 --> 00:10:33.476
Someone else will be in Soo Chang's hospital bed.

146
00:10:40.786 --> 00:10:42.486
Gosh, it's stuffy in here.

147
00:10:43.085 --> 00:10:44.656
Did you get rid of him?

148
00:10:47.756 --> 00:10:50.726
- Dong Tak. - The EMTs are here.

149
00:10:51.656 --> 00:10:52.825
Over here.

150
00:11:02.435 --> 00:11:05.036
- What? - Get over here now.

151
00:11:05.036 --> 00:11:07.345
Gong Soo Chang isn't doing so well.

152
00:11:20.016 --> 00:11:22.286
Today is the 49th day.

153
00:11:23.656 --> 00:11:24.756
Detective Cha.

154
00:11:25.656 --> 00:11:27.496
I'm really scared now.

155
00:11:27.526 --> 00:11:29.325
Hang in there, Soo Chang.

156
00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:32.195
Please. Hang in there.

157
00:11:42.776 --> 00:11:44.976
Could you give us a comment?

158
00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:47.146
This investigation was not carried out...

159
00:11:47.786 --> 00:11:49.685
according to legal procedures,

160
00:11:50.685 --> 00:11:53.455
and there was no evidence to back it up.

161
00:11:53.925 --> 00:11:55.455
Therefore, I shall go free.

162
00:11:55.455 --> 00:11:57.825
Do you deny all the charges?

163
00:11:57.825 --> 00:11:59.126
The charges?

164
00:12:00.356 --> 00:12:02.896
There were none whatsoever.

165
00:12:04.465 --> 00:12:08.165
I was targeted purely because I was about to...

166
00:12:08.165 --> 00:12:10.106
become Minister of Justice.

167
00:12:12.236 --> 00:12:14.075
I'm Prosecutor Tak Jae Hee.

168
00:12:19.476 --> 00:12:21.386
The investigation on Director Tak...

169
00:12:24.756 --> 00:12:27.555
was legal and carried out under my supervision.

170
00:12:27.656 --> 00:12:28.786
I will...

171
00:12:29.026 --> 00:12:31.526
reveal the truth to the whole of Korea.

172
00:12:35.626 --> 00:12:37.165
You choose.

173
00:12:41.935 --> 00:12:44.036
You're a prosecutor.

174
00:12:44.036 --> 00:12:46.435
I hope you justify your prosecutor badge.

175
00:12:47.006 --> 00:12:48.175
We will...

176
00:12:48.575 --> 00:12:50.006
charge Director Tak...

177
00:12:50.406 --> 00:12:52.715
for murder and instigation of murder.

178
00:12:55.146 --> 00:12:56.345
Let's go.

179
00:12:56.516 --> 00:12:58.215
When was this planned?

180
00:12:58.215 --> 00:13:00.215
Isn't Director Tak...

181
00:13:00.215 --> 00:13:02.656
- your father? - You will charge your own father?

182
00:13:08.065 --> 00:13:09.226
Jae Hee.

183
00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:12.496
Remember just one thing.

184
00:13:14.136 --> 00:13:15.335
I did it all...

185
00:13:16.606 --> 00:13:18.376
for your sake.

186
00:13:21.345 --> 00:13:23.606
Yes. I know that.

187
00:13:25.616 --> 00:13:27.786
I am doing this for your sake.

188
00:13:30.656 --> 00:13:32.016
- Cuff him. - Yes, sir.

189
00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:48.506
- Step back. - You can all leave.

190
00:13:49.006 --> 00:13:50.906
- Let's go. - Go, go.

191
00:13:59.445 --> 00:14:02.415
Those who are guilty will pay now.

192
00:14:03.185 --> 00:14:04.585
Exactly.

193
00:14:04.915 --> 00:14:08.486
That's why we're detectives, kid.

194
00:14:09.425 --> 00:14:10.955
- 100 joules. - Charged.

195
00:14:11.425 --> 00:14:12.825
1, 2, shoot.

196
00:14:14.695 --> 00:14:16.695
- 150 joules. - Charged.

197
00:14:17.236 --> 00:14:19.335
1, 2, shoot.

198
00:14:20.136 --> 00:14:21.835
- 200 joules. - Charged.

199
00:14:23.136 --> 00:14:24.876
1, 2, shoot.

200
00:14:30.376 --> 00:14:32.746
I think I'm really about to die.

201
00:14:37.516 --> 00:14:39.116
- Pulse? - Not yet.

202
00:14:39.116 --> 00:14:40.256
Keep going.

203
00:14:44.825 --> 00:14:47.266
Do you want to save him?

204
00:14:47.266 --> 00:14:48.465
Then...

205
00:14:49.695 --> 00:14:51.465
give it to him.

206
00:14:52.095 --> 00:14:54.705
No way. Is that it?

207
00:14:55.406 --> 00:14:57.575
Give him my body so he can live?

208
00:15:07.486 --> 00:15:09.286
- Now? - Not yet.

209
00:15:09.286 --> 00:15:10.516
Check his vitals again.

210
00:15:12.815 --> 00:15:14.026
Goodbye,

211
00:15:17.455 --> 00:15:18.626
Cha Dong Tak.

212
00:15:43.345 --> 00:15:44.555
What happened?

213
00:15:44.756 --> 00:15:45.955
Atonement.

214
00:15:46.156 --> 00:15:50.185
The detective gave you his body.

215
00:15:50.555 --> 00:15:52.455
This was your homework.

216
00:15:52.795 --> 00:15:55.766
Stay in there until your own body dies.

217
00:15:56.026 --> 00:15:58.736
Then you can live in him forever.

218
00:16:00.496 --> 00:16:02.205
And Cha Dong Tak?

219
00:16:02.465 --> 00:16:04.376
He'll never come back.

220
00:16:06.536 --> 00:16:07.845
The idiot.

221
00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.016
No.

222
00:16:12.246 --> 00:16:13.746
No!

223
00:16:15.185 --> 00:16:16.345
No.

224
00:16:26.369 --> 00:16:31.369
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E32 Two Cops "49th Day"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

225
00:16:42.246 --> 00:16:44.246
Why did you do it? Why?

226
00:16:44.276 --> 00:16:47.215
Why did you do it? Why?

227
00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:50.486
Do you want to make me a thief who stole your body?

228
00:17:04.536 --> 00:17:05.565
No.

229
00:17:08.706 --> 00:17:09.835
No.

230
00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:19.815
No.

231
00:18:00.986 --> 00:18:02.186
Soo Chang.

232
00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:03.655
You're back.

233
00:18:06.355 --> 00:18:07.625
Who...

234
00:18:08.365 --> 00:18:09.466
Me?

235
00:18:10.295 --> 00:18:11.436
Come on.

236
00:18:11.835 --> 00:18:13.536
It's me, Ko Bong.

237
00:18:13.766 --> 00:18:16.065
- Bong? - Your sidekick.

238
00:18:16.065 --> 00:18:18.036
I don't kick people.

239
00:18:18.036 --> 00:18:19.206
Why...

240
00:18:20.575 --> 00:18:22.176
What are you doing?

241
00:18:22.176 --> 00:18:23.305
Wait.

242
00:18:23.305 --> 00:18:26.615
We picked pockets and conned people together.

243
00:18:26.615 --> 00:18:28.385
What are you saying?

244
00:18:28.385 --> 00:18:31.216
You suddenly show up and call me a pickpocket and conman?

245
00:18:31.456 --> 00:18:33.486
I'm a model citizen.

246
00:18:34.055 --> 00:18:36.155
You seem pretty young.

247
00:18:36.155 --> 00:18:37.395
Don't live like that.

248
00:18:37.426 --> 00:18:39.655
Don't waste the rest of your life.

249
00:18:39.655 --> 00:18:40.666
Be honest.

250
00:18:40.666 --> 00:18:44.635
You fell into the Han River with a detective...

251
00:18:44.766 --> 00:18:47.405
and woke up after being in a coma for 49 days.

252
00:18:47.405 --> 00:18:50.006
- What are you saying? - Soo Chang.

253
00:18:50.305 --> 00:18:52.176
Do you really not remember me?

254
00:18:52.176 --> 00:18:54.006
Something must be wrong with his brain.

255
00:18:54.006 --> 00:18:55.345
Who's Soo Chang?

256
00:19:01.545 --> 00:19:04.155
Do you not remember me, Soo Chang?

257
00:19:08.325 --> 00:19:11.095
Did we meet somewhere before?

258
00:19:13.426 --> 00:19:14.595
No, right?

259
00:19:15.895 --> 00:19:18.736
My goodness, you're so not my type.

260
00:19:19.266 --> 00:19:20.536
Hang on.

261
00:19:22.105 --> 00:19:24.506
Did he damage his brain?

262
00:19:25.905 --> 00:19:27.006
Hey.

263
00:19:27.706 --> 00:19:28.706
Here.

264
00:19:30.845 --> 00:19:32.216
What's this?

265
00:19:32.645 --> 00:19:33.946
Thank you.

266
00:19:35.315 --> 00:19:37.286
You looked after me.

267
00:19:38.216 --> 00:19:39.286
Right.

268
00:19:41.085 --> 00:19:42.585
- Does it smell nice? - Yes.

269
00:19:44.295 --> 00:19:47.266
It's good to see you like this.

270
00:19:51.795 --> 00:19:53.196
- You. - What?

271
00:19:54.506 --> 00:19:55.635
What, sir?

272
00:19:58.736 --> 00:20:00.805
It's good to see you in your body.

273
00:20:03.276 --> 00:20:04.345
Hey.

274
00:20:04.615 --> 00:20:07.045
Did I not have a body or something?

275
00:20:07.045 --> 00:20:09.916
Did I walk around like a ghost?

276
00:20:09.916 --> 00:20:11.456
Gong Soo Chang, do you really...

277
00:20:13.615 --> 00:20:14.726
not remember?

278
00:20:14.726 --> 00:20:16.726
I don't. I can't remember.

279
00:20:16.726 --> 00:20:19.055
Who are you? Am I Gong Soo Chang?

280
00:20:21.526 --> 00:20:22.565
Yes.

281
00:20:23.266 --> 00:20:24.536
My forever...

282
00:20:27.805 --> 00:20:28.936
partner.

283
00:20:33.335 --> 00:20:36.345
You and I, did we do something together?

284
00:20:39.176 --> 00:20:41.545
We did a lot. And got into trouble.

285
00:20:41.815 --> 00:20:43.246
We caught bad guys.

286
00:20:44.756 --> 00:20:46.055
Am I a cop?

287
00:20:48.085 --> 00:20:49.155
Yes.

288
00:20:51.655 --> 00:20:53.496
You were better than a cop.

289
00:20:58.196 --> 00:20:59.466
You were a fraud.

290
00:21:01.105 --> 00:21:02.536
What? What?

291
00:21:07.506 --> 00:21:10.506
- Ready? Drink to the death - Drink to the death

292
00:21:18.555 --> 00:21:20.926
Director Tak Jung Hwan, Jin Soo A,

293
00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:23.585
and Chairman Jo. Well done on getting them all.

294
00:21:23.996 --> 00:21:27.196
Especially you, Dong Tak. Well done.

295
00:21:28.226 --> 00:21:29.625
I just did my job.

296
00:21:29.726 --> 00:21:32.996
Dong Ki, being jobless seems to suit you.

297
00:21:33.065 --> 00:21:35.605
You look so handsome now.

298
00:21:35.605 --> 00:21:36.805
Come on.

299
00:21:36.835 --> 00:21:38.206
I'm not jobless.

300
00:21:38.405 --> 00:21:42.276
Captain, your recommendation worked. I got a job. Thank you.

301
00:21:42.276 --> 00:21:44.746
Did it work out? That's great.

302
00:21:44.875 --> 00:21:46.976
That's one more thing to celebrate.

303
00:21:46.976 --> 00:21:49.286
Is today a special day?

304
00:21:54.726 --> 00:21:58.395
I bet Hang Joon crossed over in peace.

305
00:21:59.895 --> 00:22:00.996
I bet.

306
00:22:02.926 --> 00:22:04.795
That's why we worked so hard.

307
00:22:04.795 --> 00:22:06.966
- It's freezing cold. - Salute.

308
00:22:07.966 --> 00:22:09.266
- Hey. - Hey!

309
00:22:09.266 --> 00:22:10.736
- You can't drink that. - Gosh.

310
00:22:11.805 --> 00:22:14.345
You invited me, and that was my first shot.

311
00:22:14.506 --> 00:22:17.105
On a day like this, we need to be prepared.

312
00:22:20.115 --> 00:22:21.115
Hey.

313
00:22:21.545 --> 00:22:23.145
- Give me one. - That's all I had.

314
00:22:23.145 --> 00:22:25.085
- I only had one packet. - These are good.

315
00:22:25.085 --> 00:22:26.256
There are a few left.

316
00:22:28.786 --> 00:22:29.825
Okay, then.

317
00:22:31.395 --> 00:22:32.625
Hang Joon.

318
00:22:33.625 --> 00:22:34.825
This is his.

319
00:22:37.766 --> 00:22:39.496
Gosh, it's cold.

320
00:22:39.496 --> 00:22:42.135
It really is winter. It's freezing cold.

321
00:22:43.166 --> 00:22:44.405
- Hey. - Hey!

322
00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:46.706
Why did you drink that?

323
00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:49.305
You quack!

324
00:22:56.246 --> 00:22:57.756
Do you still work here?

325
00:22:58.686 --> 00:22:59.855
Why ask?

326
00:23:00.256 --> 00:23:02.186
I don't pick pockets now.

327
00:23:03.585 --> 00:23:04.895
Then date me.

328
00:23:05.795 --> 00:23:07.395
- What? - Date?

329
00:23:08.595 --> 00:23:11.436
I'll date anyone but pickpockets, frauds,

330
00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:13.236
and gold diggers.

331
00:23:13.766 --> 00:23:15.036
Why would...

332
00:23:16.565 --> 00:23:19.575
a cop try to dupe a pickpocket?

333
00:23:19.575 --> 00:23:20.805
It's not a con.

334
00:23:21.645 --> 00:23:24.476
I'm asking you to be my girlfriend.

335
00:23:26.516 --> 00:23:28.286
- Girlfriend. - Girlfriend?

336
00:23:28.486 --> 00:23:29.885
Me, yours?

337
00:23:30.555 --> 00:23:31.585
Do you think...

338
00:23:32.456 --> 00:23:34.186
I'll run away?

339
00:23:35.125 --> 00:23:37.696
Fine. Let's date.

340
00:23:38.155 --> 00:23:40.125
- It's on. - It's on.

341
00:23:40.895 --> 00:23:42.325
Well done.

342
00:23:43.226 --> 00:23:45.635
- Is it day one? - Congratulations.

343
00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:47.506
I want to date too.

344
00:23:51.105 --> 00:23:52.976
Is that angel woman okay?

345
00:23:54.045 --> 00:23:55.145
Yes.

346
00:23:55.545 --> 00:23:57.075
Her surgery went well.

347
00:23:59.645 --> 00:24:02.486
What about Mr. Tak? Is he doing well?

348
00:24:04.216 --> 00:24:07.756
Right about now, he'll be with the prosecutor he hates the most.

349
00:24:09.085 --> 00:24:11.655
We shall begin the interrogation.

350
00:24:13.095 --> 00:24:14.795
Here are your rights.

351
00:24:15.095 --> 00:24:16.426
You can answer...

352
00:24:16.726 --> 00:24:20.335
the following questions with a yes or a no.

353
00:24:25.575 --> 00:24:26.805
Do you understand?

354
00:24:34.286 --> 00:24:35.686
You are well-taught.

355
00:24:38.916 --> 00:24:41.385
Thanks for clearing my dad's name...

356
00:24:41.555 --> 00:24:43.385
and for catching the killer.

357
00:24:43.956 --> 00:24:46.295
You did everything you had to do...

358
00:24:46.295 --> 00:24:48.526
and kept your promise with Soo Chang.

359
00:24:49.895 --> 00:24:51.395
I still have a lot to do.

360
00:24:53.635 --> 00:24:56.335
There are numbers of victims out there.

361
00:24:56.635 --> 00:25:00.206
A detective always promises that they'll catch the criminal.

362
00:25:00.206 --> 00:25:01.776
I still have a lot to go...

363
00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:03.746
to keep all my promises.

364
00:25:04.916 --> 00:25:07.075
Detective Cha, you sound like a real grown-up.

365
00:25:07.246 --> 00:25:08.286
A real good grown-up.

366
00:25:08.286 --> 00:25:10.115
You're a real grown-up too.

367
00:25:10.416 --> 00:25:13.585
Oh, congratulations on reporting your news live.

368
00:25:14.855 --> 00:25:16.125
Thank you.

369
00:25:16.986 --> 00:25:20.295
Right, where do you reckon Soo Chang is?

370
00:25:20.295 --> 00:25:22.496
If he never gets his memory back,

371
00:25:22.696 --> 00:25:24.895
he might never return to see us.

372
00:25:26.966 --> 00:25:28.236
Are you disappointed?

373
00:25:29.835 --> 00:25:31.135
I'm not.

374
00:25:34.206 --> 00:25:35.946
"I like your attitude."

375
00:25:37.976 --> 00:25:41.385
"Ssong, from now on, you will only look at me,"

376
00:25:41.385 --> 00:25:44.815
"get angry at me, and only smile at me."

377
00:25:50.595 --> 00:25:52.055
Isn't that what he said?

378
00:25:57.966 --> 00:25:59.365
You surprised me.

379
00:26:02.206 --> 00:26:03.236
That's hot.

380
00:26:04.075 --> 00:26:05.405
Be careful.

381
00:26:21.426 --> 00:26:23.825
(Jo Hang Joon)

382
00:26:29.666 --> 00:26:31.996
Hey, are you crying?

383
00:26:31.996 --> 00:26:33.436
Gosh.

384
00:26:35.065 --> 00:26:36.835
How many times do I have to tell you?

385
00:26:37.635 --> 00:26:39.905
I have dry eyes.

386
00:26:48.615 --> 00:26:51.355
I finally got them all, Hang Joon.

387
00:26:52.355 --> 00:26:53.716
Dong Tak.

388
00:26:54.286 --> 00:26:56.855
Now, you'll surely live well without me.

389
00:26:57.825 --> 00:27:01.226
Great job, Detective Cha Dong Tak.

390
00:27:31.456 --> 00:27:33.395
It's been so long since I looked up into the sky.

391
00:27:51.645 --> 00:27:52.946
Do you have a lighter?

392
00:27:53.916 --> 00:27:55.916
You look like a detective.

393
00:27:55.916 --> 00:27:57.756
How rude of you to ask me for a lighter?

394
00:27:59.016 --> 00:28:01.555
Gosh, I'm so sick of that darned lighter.

395
00:28:01.555 --> 00:28:03.456
You continue to be so rude to your elder.

396
00:28:07.325 --> 00:28:08.526
Who's my elder?

397
00:28:09.926 --> 00:28:12.536
I asked Detective Jo in front of his ashes,

398
00:28:13.295 --> 00:28:14.966
and he told us to be friends.

399
00:28:15.305 --> 00:28:18.075
If you insist on being older than me or something,

400
00:28:18.276 --> 00:28:19.436
it'll only complicate things.

401
00:28:19.436 --> 00:28:22.605
How can a detective be friends with a crook?

402
00:28:25.315 --> 00:28:26.746
Fine, we'll be friends.

403
00:28:29.545 --> 00:28:30.885
If you joke around...

404
00:28:30.885 --> 00:28:33.655
and say that you don't remember, I'll kill you.

405
00:28:33.655 --> 00:28:34.756
No.

406
00:28:35.956 --> 00:28:37.655
I'm going to joke around.

407
00:28:37.825 --> 00:28:39.526
That's who I am.

408
00:28:39.526 --> 00:28:41.466
I just want to be me.

409
00:28:50.805 --> 00:28:53.835
- What are these? - What do you think? Handcuffs.

410
00:28:54.545 --> 00:28:56.476
The key is at the station.

411
00:28:59.446 --> 00:29:00.476
My gosh.

412
00:29:01.315 --> 00:29:03.045
What will you do from now on?

413
00:29:03.815 --> 00:29:04.956
I'm not sure.

414
00:29:06.186 --> 00:29:07.456
I want...

415
00:29:07.885 --> 00:29:09.855
to keep doing what I'm good at.

416
00:29:09.855 --> 00:29:10.895
What?

417
00:29:11.595 --> 00:29:12.855
Being a crook?

418
00:29:14.825 --> 00:29:15.825
No.

419
00:29:16.526 --> 00:29:19.536
I'm going to stick right next to you...

420
00:29:19.536 --> 00:29:22.605
- Oh, a detective's sidekick. - A sidekick?

421
00:29:23.006 --> 00:29:26.135
I can't believe you use such an old word.

422
00:29:26.476 --> 00:29:28.045
There's a better word.

423
00:29:30.145 --> 00:29:31.276
A partner.

424
00:29:37.855 --> 00:29:41.055
Hey, that hurts. Let me go now.

425
00:29:41.625 --> 00:29:44.855
I don't have the key. It's at the police station.

426
00:29:46.795 --> 00:29:49.526
- Stop joking around. - I'm not. I mean it.

427
00:29:50.966 --> 00:29:52.036
Are you insane?

428
00:29:52.036 --> 00:29:54.506
Wait, you're trying to make me drive.

429
00:29:55.405 --> 00:29:58.135
- Looking good. - Looking...

430
00:29:58.335 --> 00:30:01.545
Gosh, nothing changed even after I came back to my body.

431
00:30:01.545 --> 00:30:04.176
- All right, let's go. - Where are we going?

432
00:30:04.176 --> 00:30:06.216
- Come on. - Why are you suddenly running?

433
00:30:06.216 --> 00:30:08.385
1, 2, 3.

434
00:30:10.186 --> 00:30:11.315
You're too fast.

435
00:30:11.655 --> 00:30:13.585
Cha Dong Tak!
