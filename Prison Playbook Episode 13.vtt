GIRLFRIEND

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.250 line:93%
CALLING

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.110 line:93%
<i>The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...</i>

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.320 line:93%
<i>Please, pick up.</i>

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.200 line:93%
<i>I have this phone for three more days.</i>

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.540 line:93%
<i>I want to hear your voice.</i>

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.170 line:93%
<i>I want to say I'm sorry.</i>

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.290 line:93%
<i>And I miss you.</i>

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.440 line:93%
She won't pick up, right?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.270 line:93%
Ji-ho is totally normal, huh?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.110 line:93%
Unlike you, she's good
with facing reality.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.360 line:93%
Oh, gosh!

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.030 line:93%
What's his problem?

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.030 line:93%
He had a fight with Captain Yoo again.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.910 line:93%
It looked like Jung-woo
was really going to kill him,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.040 line:93%
so Lieutenant Paeng brought him here.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.420 line:93%
He's clearly affection-deprived.
He's always clinging onto people,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.920 line:93%
but he starts up with them first.
He's clingy to you too, right?

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.470 line:93%
Yeah, you nailed it.
I'm affection-deprived.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.720 line:93%
You must be Brainy Smurf.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.070 line:93%
He's smart.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.410 line:93%
How did you know I was affection-deprived?

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.580 line:93%
My mom cares only about money.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.120 line:93%
When I was studying in Japan
and came home after two years,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.170 line:93%
and when my maternal grandma passed away,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.090 line:93%
my mom opened the restaurant and worked.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.930 line:93%
She likes money much more

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.220 line:93%
than her one and only son.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.350 line:93%
I was always lonely.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.310 line:93%
A lot of kids from rich families
are affection-deprived like you.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.650 line:93%
Hey.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.690 line:93%
I hear your family owns
Master Yoo's Spicy Shortribs. Right?

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.070 line:93%
Wow. I went there yesterday,
and they opened another wing.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.620 line:93%
You went there yesterday? With whom?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.170 line:93%
No comment.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.590 line:93%
You're dating, aren't you?

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.090 line:93%
Gosh. The poor woman.
She's dating a player.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.470 line:93%
I really pity her.
Will you make brownies again?

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.890 line:93%
You punk!

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.270 line:93%
You have lice! Lice!

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.100 line:93%
What? I have what?

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.980 line:93%
Look. Here.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.900 line:93%
This...

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.110 line:93%
This is lice. Gross. Shit.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.530 line:93%
Lice...

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.240 line:93%
You bastard.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.410 line:93%
-It's okay, they'll die.
-Kaist...

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.240 line:93%
YESTERDAY

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.580 line:93%
Why are you giving me so much
when I eat for free?

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.290 line:93%
You're our only eat-free-for-life
customer, so I should give you a lot.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.380 line:93%
You brought your girlfriend today.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.170 line:93%
About six or seven months ago,
your boyfriend

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.350 line:93%
came all by himself, and ate all of this
in just 20 minutes.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.180 line:93%
He was skinny, so I didn't think...

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.810 line:93%
Honey. Don't bother the customers
with your babble.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.060 line:93%
Go clear that table.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.700 line:93%
I'm sorry. I was a bit loud.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.360 line:93%
-Not at all.
-Enjoy.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.990 line:93%
Let us know if you need more.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.240 line:93%
Enjoy.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.170 line:93%
The owner is super scary.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.670 line:93%
Come to think of it, their son's got guts.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.090 line:93%
How did he do drugs
when his mom is so scary?

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.970 line:93%
Their son did drugs?

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.970 line:93%
Yeah. He's in our prison.
In the same cell as Je-hyeok.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.560 line:93%
Is he nice?

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.810 line:93%
No one in prison is nice
except for your brother.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.570 line:93%
He's kind of...

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.610 line:93%
strange. I can't quite read him.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.530 line:93%
Your mom is super scary.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.330 line:93%
How did you do drugs behind her back?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.330 line:93%
My mom isn't interested in me.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.250 line:93%
She wouldn't know if I went missing.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.960 line:93%
-Why you... You brat.
-Seriously... How could you say that?

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.250 line:93%
It's true.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.050 line:93%
This is why I hate kids
from rich families.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.550 line:93%
They don't know gratitude.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.810 line:93%
Joon-ho, remember the rich kid we knew
when we were little?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.060 line:93%
His dad had a big business.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.730 line:93%
He had the first Game Boy in our class.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.270 line:93%
That was the first time
I envied someone for being rich.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.690 line:93%
Yeah, that's right.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.490 line:93%
I begged my mom for over a year

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.450 line:93%
and finally got it for my birthday.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.870 line:93%
I begged for like two to three years
and finally got one.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.920 line:93%
Do you know how civilians like us live?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.460 line:93%
I never had a game console.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.130 line:93%
You don't know anything.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.350 line:93%
<i>I think my family was
one of the poorest families in Gangbuk.</i>

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.190 line:93%
<i>All I remember from my childhood</i>

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.320 line:93%
<i>-is the frequent moving...</i>
-I'm going to the restaurant.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.400 line:93%
Mommy, I'm hungry.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.610 line:93%
I made instant noodles. Eat that.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.490 line:93%
<i>And instant noodles that my mom
made me every morning</i>

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.450 line:93%
<i>before leaving for work.</i>

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.710 line:93%
Run!

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.210 line:93%
Run!

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.100 line:93%
You stink. Gross.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.440 line:93%
<i>My clothes were dirty
and I couldn't bathe often,</i>

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.770 line:93%
<i>so I was always left out
since grade school.</i>

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.190 line:93%
<i>No. I shunned everyone else.</i>

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.650 line:93%
<i>I hated jerks like that.</i>

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.570 line:93%
<i>I shunned them because they were annoying.</i>

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.830 line:93%
UI JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.710 line:93%
<i>My mom saved up like crazy
and opened a restaurant.</i>

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.340 line:93%
<i>From ninth grade, we were well-off enough
that every season,</i>

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.300 line:93%
<i>they bought me name brand shoes,
although they were cheap.</i>

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.180 line:93%
<i>But I was still an outcast.</i>

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.350 line:93%
<i>Of course, I shunned them.
I didn't need friends.</i>

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.520 line:93%
<i>I didn't want to play soccer at all,</i>

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.350 line:93%
<i>and I didn't want to go to Internet cafes</i>

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.860 line:93%
<i>with friends.</i>

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.770 line:93%
<i>I liked being alone.</i>

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.910 line:93%
We need one more player.
Do you want to play?

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.450 line:93%
Play with me.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.040 line:93%
<i>Ji-won was our class president.</i>

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.380 line:93%
Pass!

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.210 line:93%
<i>Everyone liked him.</i>

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.000 line:93%
<i>He had a great personality.</i>

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.130 line:93%
Shoot! Shoot!

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.550 line:93%
<i>I became his sidekick from that day on.</i>

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.140 line:93%
<i>I liked him from the start.</i>

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.770 line:93%
-Hey! Take it!
<i>-From the start.</i>

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:14.770 line:93%
Pass! Pass!

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.350 line:93%
<i>I liked everything about him.</i>

JEONGSEON'S SNACKS

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.780 line:93%
Are you brothers? You look identical.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.400 line:93%
No way!

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.070 line:93%
We're not brothers.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.950 line:93%
Okay, fine. It's no big deal.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.540 line:93%
Okay.

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:35.660 line:93%
We're friends.

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.120 line:93%
Best friends.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.870 line:93%
Really?

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:41.960 line:93%
He's my best friend.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.460 line:93%
Right?

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.180 line:93%
<i>Then, we went to high school.</i>

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.510 line:93%
<i>I transferred to Gangnam,</i>

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.270 line:93%
and Ji-won moved to the US
because of his dad's job.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.900 line:93%
But still, just once...

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.610 line:93%
Just once, I wanted to say it.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.320 line:93%
<i>So, I wrote an email.</i>

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.620 line:93%
<i>A love letter.</i>

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.330 line:93%
I finally have the courage to tell you.
I like you. Not as a friend.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.960 line:93%
I like you as more than a friend.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.050 line:93%
SEND

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.970 line:93%
<i>I mustered up courage and sent the email.</i>

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.620 line:93%
Hi, Ji-won. It's Han-yang.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.870 line:93%
I'll go to the airport to see you off.
I like you. Not as a friend.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.460 line:93%
I like you as more than a friend.

<i>We only stayed in touch after that.</i>

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.670 line:93%
He returned to Korea,

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.890 line:93%
and we met again junior year in college
at our junior high school reunion.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.640 line:93%
Then, Ji-won asked me out first.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.350 line:93%
Ji-won asked me.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.940 line:93%
That's when we started dating.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.650 line:93%
Why did I start talking about that?

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:37.910 line:93%
I guess...

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.910 line:93%
So, you went to a co-ed school?

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.920 line:93%
Plenty of girls are good at soccer.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.290 line:93%
Ji-won

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.630 line:93%
is a guy.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.890 line:93%
It feels so good to say it out loud.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.890 line:93%
I feel free.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.890 line:93%
We're even now.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.530 line:93%
I pretended not to know
that you two were best friends,

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.070 line:93%
so do the same for me.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.990 line:93%
Please.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.830 line:93%
I knew you two were close friends,
but wow,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.540 line:93%
you were friends since grade school.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.760 line:93%
No wonder you two seemed so close.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.220 line:93%
I didn't tell you, did I?

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.640 line:93%
We're childhood friends.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.480 line:93%
You knew too.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.890 line:93%
Thanks for playing dumb.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.650 line:93%
Just eat your ice cream.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.530 line:93%
It's okay. I know you're shocked.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.110 line:93%
You're terrible actors.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.880 line:93%
PRISON PLAYBOOK

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.130 line:93%
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.850 line:93%
Wow. Je-hyeok Kim is amazing.
Simply amazing.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.810 line:93%
I thought he was kidding.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.610 line:93%
I never thought he'd ask to put him
back in their cell.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.520 line:93%
He's an athlete.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.980 line:93%
He looks dumb, but he knows how to win.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.490 line:93%
It's a good idea. It is.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.990 line:93%
Whatever. It's easier said than done.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.580 line:93%
A storm is about to hit that cell.
It's imminent.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.500 line:93%
<i>Delivery!</i>

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.780 line:93%
Have a nice day.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.800 line:93%
Stop it. Not you too.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.130 line:93%
-We should distribute the items.
-Yeah.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.560 line:93%
I think the people in our cell
are too nice.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.680 line:93%
How could we take in that scumbag?
We should just...

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.140 line:93%
Okay.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.440 line:93%
Everyone gather round.
I ordered apricot tea.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.440 line:93%
It's hot. Let's drink some cold tea.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.790 line:93%
Hey. Come here.
We ordered one for you too.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.130 line:93%
You don't have a summer blanket.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.630 line:93%
-Jung-woo, you ordered it, right?
-I did.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.300 line:93%
Hurry up. You're embarrassed, aren't you?

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.770 line:93%
He makes me nervous.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:33.350 line:93%
You've been glaring at us
and trying to be scary,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.820 line:93%
so you feel too awkward and humiliated
to try to get along now, right?

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.900 line:93%
It's okay. He was a total prick
when he first came too.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.620 line:93%
-Hey you. Come here.
-What?

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.290 line:93%
Stop hiding in the corner there,
and come eat with us.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.670 line:93%
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.000 line:93%
-Do as you're told!
-Hurry!

00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.920 line:93%
Listen to the adults.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.630 line:93%
-You won't listen?
-One, two...

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.260 line:93%
-Seriously.
-Good.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.140 line:93%
-Punk.
-I'll shave off all your hair.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.140 line:93%
Okay, today's delivery.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.270 line:93%
Milk. It'll spoil, so take them. One each.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.020 line:93%
There are six. Perfect.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.310 line:93%
-I had a Banana Kick.
-Hey.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.650 line:93%
-Are you happy?
-Sit comfortably.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.150 line:93%
-Who ordered socks?
-Me.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.780 line:93%
Min-chul, let's have the tea later.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.950 line:93%
This takes a lot of effort.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.290 line:93%
You said to gather to have apricot tea,
but you won't serve it?

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.040 line:93%
-They'll be okay, right?
-Of course.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.290 line:93%
Am I the only one who sees

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.500 line:93%
Crony's new boss?

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:51.100 line:93%
Really? I'll get the ice.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.640 line:93%
-Then you do it.
-Put that down.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.440 line:93%
You can't take the last one, you bastard.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.350 line:93%
What?

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.570 line:93%
Really? Why?

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.190 line:93%
I got the warden's permission.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.240 line:93%
Crony will return to our cell,

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.660 line:93%
and he will help me train.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.740 line:93%
No. What if he tries something again?

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.000 line:93%
I'm sure Je-hyeok has a plan.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.330 line:93%
He has a reputation
for being a troublemaker,

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.670 line:93%
so no prison will take him anyway.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.380 line:93%
Even if they do, it'll take time,

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.510 line:93%
so I figured it would be better
to keep him close.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.970 line:93%
As long as I hold it in
and make the effort.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:33.930 line:93%
That's why.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.430 line:93%
Still, it's too dangerous to share cells.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.900 line:93%
You're so frustrating.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.770 line:93%
Don't mind him. I'm for it.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.110 line:93%
Me too.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.570 line:93%
This line comes to mine.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.990 line:93%
"Keep your friends close,
and your enemies closer."

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.490 line:93%
That's true, but...

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.790 line:93%
Did he agree?

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.290 line:93%
The lowlives he's close to
won't stand for it.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.580 line:93%
He seemed worried about them,
so I said I'd take care of it for him.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.800 line:93%
What? Take care of what?

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.260 line:93%
What else? The gnats.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.010 line:93%
How did you get into a military academy
with that brain?

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.850 line:93%
You donated a building to the school,
didn't you?

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.770 line:93%
Put down the pot.

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.820 line:93%
-Is that right?
-Yes.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.610 line:93%
He was born to be a Number Two.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.320 line:93%
I'll be his Number One.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.250 line:93%
-Please help me.
-You bastard.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.080 line:93%
Tell him to bring it again.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.800 line:93%
That's...

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.090 line:93%
What the hell?

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.130 line:93%
Why is Crony over there?

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.180 line:93%
Look who this is.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.140 line:93%
If it isn't the famous Je-hyeok Kim.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.600 line:93%
Why are you keeping that trash with you?

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.350 line:93%
Huh?

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:45.060 line:93%
Why?

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.030 line:93%
Have you lost your fricking...

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.670 line:93%
You can't go first!
You're after the gasoline!

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.090 line:93%
I'm sorry.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:15.930 line:93%
I got too excited.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.390 line:93%
Hey! Return those tools right now.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.600 line:93%
The flowers in the greenhouse
are about to die without the oil!

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.100 line:93%
Yes, sir.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.520 line:93%
Seriously. You are such a pain.
Such a pain!

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:34.280 line:93%
Why did I carry this here?

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.580 line:93%
<i>The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...</i>

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.470 line:93%
You have one day left.
Captain Na is counting the hours.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.680 line:93%
Joon-ho.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.800 line:93%
Help me break out.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.470 line:93%
Sure.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.056 line:93%
Hey, Je-hyeok. Je-hyeok! Hey! No!

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.740 line:93%
Help me break out.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.410 line:93%
Sure.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.300 line:93%
Hey, Je-hyeok. Je-hyeok! Hey! No!

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.230 line:93%
Okay.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.560 line:93%
Yeah, let's just exercise instead.
That's good.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.320 line:93%
You need to train Crony. Should I get him?

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.400 line:93%
No. I won't exercise.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.700 line:93%
<i>The person you have reached...</i>

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.830 line:93%
<i>The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...</i>

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.130 line:93%
JE-HYEOK

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.130 line:93%
Let's go home.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.260 line:93%
I'll take you. Let's go.

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.140 line:93%
I'm going to study some more.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.930 line:93%
Then me too.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.270 line:93%
You keep studying at the cafe now.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:16.730 line:93%
I'll come here too.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.440 line:93%
My phone keeps ringing,
so I can't study in the library.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.320 line:93%
Let's go to the movies tomorrow.
I got tickets to a sneak preview.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:24.990 line:93%
Go with me.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.280 line:93%
What are you up to?
Why should I watch a movie with you?

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.740 line:93%
I rejected you badly. Do you have amnesia?

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.790 line:93%
Can't you watch a movie with a friend?

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.880 line:93%
-We did it a lot before.
-That was before you said you liked me.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.550 line:93%
I won't go to the movies with you anymore.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.170 line:93%
And I'm fine studying together,
but please sit there.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.970 line:93%
Didn't you break up with your boyfriend?

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.300 line:93%
You broke up with Je-hyeok.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.260 line:93%
Yeah, we did.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.390 line:93%
-But?
-But what?

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.270 line:93%
Even if I break up with Je-hyeok
100 times, I won't go out with you.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.310 line:93%
Dream on.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.570 line:93%
Get over there.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:04.440 line:93%
Fine.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:08.280 line:93%
JE-HYEOK

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.170 line:93%
-Wait for me.
-Don't follow me, or I'll...

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.310 line:93%
Did you ever play baseball?
Do you know what a catcher is?

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.860 line:93%
I played until junior high.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.730 line:93%
I never played catcher, though.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.780 line:93%
I can do it.
I'm good at anything physical.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.040 line:93%
He's a total cyborg.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.330 line:93%
He's gifted in sports.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.820 line:93%
That's enough.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.320 line:93%
That's enough!

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.370 line:93%
Hey, stop!

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.410 line:93%
Shit!

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.670 line:93%
Don't kick it. Don't...

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.380 line:93%
It's okay.
He's just out of his mind right now.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.090 line:93%
Turn around for a minute.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.600 line:93%
-Stop it, you punk.
-Just a minute.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.770 line:93%
-Stop it. You're being a stalker.
-What?

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.060 line:93%
This isn't stalking.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.900 line:93%
Stay still. You've done plenty.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.530 line:93%
Don't do it. Give me that.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:11.610 line:93%
-What's wrong with you?
-Don't do it.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.110 line:93%
Wait.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.160 line:93%
What's wrong with you?
Let me make one call.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.250 line:93%
-What? What's wrong with you?
-Wait.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.870 line:93%
-Just one call.
-Crony can't see that.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.080 line:93%
Keep it down.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:25.580 line:93%
I said, don't.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.210 line:93%
-Don't do it.
-Just one minute.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.590 line:93%
-No.
-Stop.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:31.840 line:93%
You bastard.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.810 line:93%
You don't have to do that.
Just do your thing.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.690 line:93%
Do what you want to do. It's okay.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.920 line:93%
If you have nothing to do,
give Min-chul a shoulder massage.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.430 line:93%
He took orders his entire life.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.940 line:93%
Telling him to do whatever he wants

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.850 line:93%
is the hardest thing for him.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.900 line:93%
Look at Han-yang.
He did whatever he wanted all his life.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.320 line:93%
Look at him. Look at that punk.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.360 line:93%
He wants another beat down
from Captain Yoo.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.210 line:93%
How sad. You missed.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.300 line:93%
I warned you several times
not to touch my things.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.590 line:93%
I won't take it anymore.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.600 line:93%
I'm going to kill you, you bastard.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.760 line:93%
Who wants spicy noodles?

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.980 line:93%
The noodles saved you.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.780 line:93%
That druggie bastard.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.200 line:93%
What did you do to the instant noodles?

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.040 line:93%
It tastes absolutely incredible.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.660 line:93%
It tastes just like the real thing.
It's better than what I had in the army.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:28.790 line:93%
How did you do it?

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:30.330 line:93%
It's easy.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.750 line:93%
First, soak the noodles in Sprite
for 30 minutes.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.220 line:93%
<i>Then the noodles become nice and sweet.</i>

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.840 line:93%
But the most important thing is the sauce.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.970 line:93%
<i>Mix the instant noodles seasoning,
the flakes, apricot tea,</i>

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.270 line:93%
<i>and three spoons of Sprite.</i>

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.560 line:93%
<i>Finally, add one-third tablespoon
of sesame oil for the finishing touch.</i>

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:55.690 line:93%
This is the Kaist special spicy noodles
passed down for generations in Munrae.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.450 line:93%
You're really good with your hands.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.110 line:93%
He made those hooks too.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.290 line:93%
Tell him if you need anything.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.040 line:93%
He is a total scumbag,
but he's very talented.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.590 line:93%
He can make anything.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.680 line:93%
It's been a while, Han-yang. Right?

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:25.510 line:93%
How dare you pretend to be Looney
and deceive us. Get over here.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.470 line:93%
Get over here, you bastard.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.640 line:93%
I said to get over here. Fine.
I'll go to you. You're dead.

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:32.900 line:93%
Refrain yourself.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.480 line:93%
Hey. Je-hyeok. Stay out of it.
You keep taking his side.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.320 line:93%
That's why he's like that. Let go.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.240 line:93%
I don't understand what you said.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.660 line:93%
You get over here too, you bastard.
I guess you envied my tongue.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.700 line:93%
I'll make yours just like mine.
Min-chul, hold his arm.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:47.660 line:93%
Arm...

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.080 line:93%
-Not me. Grab him.
-Chul-doo Kang.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.620 line:93%
-You have mail.
-Who cares?

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.790 line:93%
I'm going to cut their tongues...

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.500 line:93%
-Let go.
-It's from Cheongju.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:58.920 line:93%
Six letters.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.760 line:93%
Let go. Okay.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:05.640 line:93%
What's with him?

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.600 line:93%
It's been a while
since you had a jail date.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.100 line:93%
-Yeah.
-Good luck.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.890 line:93%
I know. Thank you so much.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.520 line:93%
From 1622 Hyeon-jeong Kim from Cheongju
From 3654 Hye-mi Kim from Cheongju

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.490 line:93%
What is all of that?

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:23.700 line:93%
Jail date.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:27.490 line:93%
It's like a pen pal program between jails.

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:31.000 line:93%
When did that punk start the jail dates?

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.790 line:93%
Yes. Six letters. Six.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.420 line:93%
Who wants a jail date?

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.380 line:93%
-With whom is it?
-Where else?

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.550 line:93%
Cheongju Female Penitentiary.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.220 line:93%
It's their cell 2B6 and our cell 2B6.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.260 line:93%
We got six letters, but no one wants?

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:49.600 line:93%
First come first served.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.600 line:93%
You're such trash.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.100 line:93%
I know already, okay?

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.190 line:93%
Jung-woo, are you in?

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:01.530 line:93%
Je-hyeok, let's do it.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.860 line:93%
I have a girlfriend.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.450 line:93%
You do? Really? Okay.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.490 line:93%
Min-chul, aren't you lonely? Join.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.330 line:93%
Knock yourself out.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.330 line:93%
-How about you, Looney?
-I'm seeing someone too.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:19.170 line:93%
God. Forget it. Fine.
I'll take them all. All of them.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.010 line:93%
You want in?

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.720 line:93%
He's Trash Number Two.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.600 line:93%
Okay. Come here. Pick.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.180 line:93%
Pick one.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:38.150 line:93%
Hold on. I can pick first, right?

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:39.980 line:93%
I... I want...

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.360 line:93%
<i>A broadcast shared with 50,000 inmates.</i>

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.070 line:93%
<i>I am Min-joo Lee, your host
of the Borami Broadcast.</i>

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.740 line:93%
<i>The summer is almost over as well.</i>

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.280 line:93%
<i>Many things come to mind
when I hear "August."</i>

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.410 line:93%
<i>Summer vacation, vacations, trips,</i>

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.750 line:93%
<i>hurricanes, monsoons, and the beach.</i>

00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:00.380 line:93%
<i>As for me, I like the word
"vacation" the most.</i>

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.460 line:93%
<i>Are you sad that you can't go on vacation?</i>

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.010 line:93%
<i>Don't be sad.</i>

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.340 line:93%
<i>Going somewhere isn't the only way
you can take a vacation.</i>

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.260 line:93%
<i>Here's the last song for today.</i>

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.020 line:93%
<i>Why don't we all go on a vacation
for a few minutes</i>

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:17.310 line:93%
<i>along with this song? "The Pearl Fishers."</i>

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.320 line:93%
Can you not read?

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.150 line:93%
How many months are you reading
<i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>?

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.530 line:93%
It's my girlfriend's favorite book.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:36.500 line:93%
She read it over ten times,
so I want to try reading it.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.670 line:93%
You should've been good while you had her.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:53.600 line:93%
I regret everything after coming here.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.060 line:93%
I should've been better to my lover.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:02.190 line:93%
Why did I take drugs and end up
being separated from the person I love?

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.360 line:93%
I mean, how am I in jail, of all places?

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.240 line:93%
My life is a mess.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.910 line:93%
He must really like prison.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.570 line:93%
Goodness...

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:49.070 line:93%
He's excited.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:50.900 line:93%
When will you grow up?

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.370 line:93%
I'm over 50 years old.
If I were going to grow up,

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:59.250 line:93%
I would've grown up long ago.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.580 line:93%
And if you grow up, you die.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.630 line:93%
-Are you proud of being in jail?
-Of course.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:11.050 line:93%
A real man should collect stars
while he's alive.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.760 line:93%
They're like medals.

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:17.180 line:93%
You're shameless. So shameless.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.720 line:93%
How many stars did you say you had?

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:25.770 line:93%
<i>Ni, er, san, si,
go, roku, shichi, hachi,</i> nine, ten. Peow.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.270 line:93%
If you have ten priors,

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:30.900 line:93%
how long were you in prison?

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.910 line:93%
How long? He was here crazy long.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.660 line:93%
He's an old Jailbird. Old Jailbird.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.370 line:93%
But Jailbird is more mature than Kaist.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.620 line:93%
Is it because you were never married?

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.590 line:93%
He was. Six times.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.420 line:93%
It's because he has no kids.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:55.800 line:93%
Even a dirtbag gets his act together
and lives a decent life if he has a kid.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.260 line:93%
I have a kid.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:00.930 line:93%
I have a son.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:04.690 line:93%
He should be 21 or 22 by now.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.310 line:93%
Aren't you ashamed to face your son?

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.360 line:93%
Aren't you ashamed to face your parents?

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.190 line:93%
-Let's not attack family.
-You started it, bastard.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:15.660 line:93%
Really?

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.280 line:93%
Then why hasn't your son
come to visit once?

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:20.950 line:93%
We cut ties long ago.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.080 line:93%
Anyway, that bastard is a real prick.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.000 line:93%
How could he not visit his dad once?

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:28.580 line:93%
He's a total dirtbag.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.630 line:93%
Don't you miss him?

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.630 line:93%
Not in the slightest.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:36.430 line:93%
You need to live together to be family.
We're strangers.

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:41.260 line:93%
And he despises me. He only likes his mom.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.270 line:93%
He thinks of me as scum.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:45.770 line:93%
You are scum.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:47.400 line:93%
I ought to...

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:52.230 line:93%
The only true single man here is Min-chul.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.440 line:93%
What a lowlife you are.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.820 line:93%
How could you pick on Big Uncle?

00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.200 line:93%
I was married too.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.330 line:93%
What? But how?

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.460 line:93%
That's a crime.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.750 line:93%
I guess... I guess that's why
people beat up Han-yang.

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:15.880 line:93%
My lawyer is good. Should I introduce you?

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:17.720 line:93%
Why you... You too?

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.930 line:93%
Stop the nonsense, and let's sleep.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:22.510 line:93%
The sun is high in the sky.

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:27.020 line:93%
Okay. Good.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.520 line:93%
You mean the moon is high in the sky.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:32.230 line:93%
You're lying, right?

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:36.860 line:93%
You've been single all your life,
so you made that up, right?

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.030 line:93%
I know!

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.910 line:93%
It's like hysterical pregnancy, right?

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:43.160 line:93%
-Hysterical pregnancy.
-Why you...

00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:46.000 line:93%
You always earn a beating. You do.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.540 line:93%
I'm going to kill you today. Okay?

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.460 line:93%
-I'll pulverize you!
-No! Stop!

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.710 line:93%
-Isn't that why your belly is so big?
-Calm down, Min-chul.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.050 line:93%
-Don't be ashamed.
-Restrain yourself.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:59.260 line:93%
You bastard!

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.550 line:93%
-You shut up.
-Hold it in.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.850 line:93%
He's always like this.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:03.850 line:93%
-Hey!
-Oh, my

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.680 line:93%
-Hey!
-Min-chul, hold it in.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.140 line:93%
-Why you...
-Oh, my.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.980 line:93%
Stop it.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.020 line:93%
What?

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.770 line:93%
-Stop it.
-You punk.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.230 line:93%
Gosh.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.730 line:93%
Stop it! Stop!

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.150 line:93%
-Je-hyeok, training.
-Min-chul, calm down.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.860 line:93%
-Stop it.
-Give me a minute.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.120 line:93%
What will you do? Hey, Looney.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.160 line:93%
-Put it down.
-Oh, no.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.410 line:93%
Oh, no.

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:29.910 line:93%
Captain Na is waiting.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.580 line:93%
He says he'll go home
after you return the phone.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.170 line:93%
One minute.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.760 line:93%
NEW MESSAGE

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:45.930 line:93%
GIRLFRIEND

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.430 line:93%
Ji-ho...

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.160 line:93%
GIRLFRIEND

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.790 line:93%
-What?
-Here. It's Ji-ho.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.550 line:93%
Go, answer.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:24.430 line:93%
Hi, Ji-ho.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.660 line:93%
It's okay. There are phone visitations.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.210 line:93%
Be understanding.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:58.420 line:93%
She's coming.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.970 line:93%
Oh, yeah!

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.970 line:93%
But Je-hyeok, what did you say
in your last text?

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:15.810 line:93%
-What?
-What did you say,

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.400 line:93%
that Ji-ho suddenly called,
after not calling

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:21.230 line:93%
or texting all this time?

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.240 line:93%
What?

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.440 line:93%
What?

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:28.400 line:93%
What else?

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.440 line:93%
That I'm sorry, and I miss her.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.240 line:93%
What else is there to say?

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.460 line:93%
<i>Ji-ho, please call.</i>

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:54.130 line:93%
<i>I don't have time.</i>

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.340 line:93%
<i>If you don't call now,</i>

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:01.390 line:93%
<i>I'll smash my right hand with a hammer.</i>

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.850 line:93%
<i>Please answer.
I have this phone for three more days.</i>

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.360 line:93%
<i>I want to hear your voice.
I want to say I'm sorry.</i>

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.570 line:93%
<i>And I miss you.</i>

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:14.110 line:93%
<i>I miss you, Ji-ho.</i>

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:16.820 line:93%
<i>I want to hear your voice.
Answer the phone.</i>

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.370 line:93%
<i>I was wrong. I'm a loser, aren't I?</i>

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.080 line:93%
<i>So please, answer the phone. Please.</i>

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.800 line:93%
FALL, 2017

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.530 line:93%
-I guess it's going well for you both.
-Yes.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.820 line:93%
-How old is she?
-Mine is 33.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.360 line:93%
Mine is 25.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.160 line:93%
We're the same age.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:08.330 line:93%
That's ridiculous.

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:10.380 line:93%
You want to die?

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.790 line:93%
You're both the same age.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.290 line:93%
It's absurd, right?

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.300 line:93%
It's just that I hate to believe
that he and I are the same age.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.340 line:93%
But I'm not saying we're friends.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:23.600 line:93%
I'm saying let's just say it's true
for the sake of argument.

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.600 line:93%
You look like that. With that face...

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.520 line:93%
How could you be only 25?
That's ridiculous.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:32.770 line:93%
Show me your ID.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.860 line:93%
Ask Lieutenant Paeng.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.780 line:93%
Who cares about age?

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:41.450 line:93%
My girlfriend is getting out next week.
She says she'll come visit.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:45.450 line:93%
She says she'll put her hair up
and wear rose-scent perfume.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.700 line:93%
Can we have visits now?

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.500 line:93%
We couldn't have visits for a while
because of the new flu.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:55.920 line:93%
That's why he's in a bad mood.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:58.670 line:93%
It was lifted today.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.260 line:93%
Visitations are allowed again.

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.720 line:93%
-Really?
-Yes.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.810 line:93%
But there's such a backlog,
they're going in order.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.880 line:93%
Well... My girlfriend also says
she's getting out next week.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.710 line:93%
Really? Congratulations.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.760 line:93%
She's going to visit.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.090 line:93%
Of course. You're her boyfriend.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.890 line:93%
With her hair up
and wearing rose scent perfume.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:54.850 line:93%
I'm a snake.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:58.520 line:93%
Can I see your letter?

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.360 line:93%
The handwriting is different.

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.070 line:93%
They're different people.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.950 line:93%
How old is she again?

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:11.250 line:93%
-She's 33.
-She's 25.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.670 line:93%
My mom always writes like that.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.590 line:93%
I'll run right on over.

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:23.220 line:93%
She also wrote "right on over."

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:27.720 line:93%
This is something people said
a long time ago.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.890 line:93%
Just how old is she?

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.720 line:93%
The same person wrote these.

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:35.560 line:93%
One with her left hand,
the other with her right.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:36.770 line:93%
Oh, no.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:40.820 line:93%
Give her up.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.400 line:93%
-That's low.
-Yes.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.110 line:93%
-You give her up.
-I cannot.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.490 line:93%
I love Lady Hwang.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.200 line:93%
-I'm in love already.
-Oh, my. You psycho.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.000 line:93%
You give her up, you bastard.

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:55.920 line:93%
I cannot.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.040 line:93%
This is insane.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.380 line:93%
Jung-woo Yoo, Han-yang Yoo, visitor.

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:06.300 line:93%
-Are you two brothers?
-Are you nuts?

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:07.550 line:93%
No, sir.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.720 line:93%
Why you... Watch it.

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:14.770 line:93%
Hey. You have a visitor.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.270 line:93%
I'm sorry. He's very sick.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:22.730 line:93%
Here's a gift.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.950 line:93%
White tulips mean "forgiveness."

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.080 line:93%
-I'm sorry.
-Excuse me.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.160 line:93%
Don't I have a visitor?

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:39.580 line:93%
Sorry. There are many people waiting,
so you'll have to wait.

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:42.840 line:93%
Yes, sir.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:55.890 line:93%
Your girlfriend?

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.270 line:93%
-Yes.
-Gosh.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.230 line:93%
You should've been good to her
while you had her.

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.400 line:93%
I know. I regret it so much.

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:09.780 line:93%
She's too good for me.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.330 line:93%
If I can see her again,

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.080 line:93%
I can do anything.

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:16.910 line:93%
Even break out?

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.340 line:93%
-My girlfriend won't like that.
-Gosh.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.920 line:93%
The mighty Je-hyeok Kim
is actually whipped.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:34.010 line:93%
Just like you, there was a person

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.680 line:93%
that I thought about 24 hours a day...

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:47.940 line:93%
And?

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:50.700 line:93%
There was someone that I liked.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:52.240 line:93%
What?

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.490 line:93%
You weren't lying?

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:57.540 line:93%
What do you take me for?

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.960 line:93%
I was really popular when I was young.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.920 line:93%
<i>A BETTER TOMORROW</i>

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:14.550 line:93%
WINTER, 1995

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.980 line:93%
I wanted to give it to you last night,
but you were asleep.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.860 line:93%
You should've woken me.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.240 line:93%
What for?

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.490 line:93%
-Do you like it?
-Yeah, I do.

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.620 line:93%
-I found...
-You found it on the street?

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:44.460 line:93%
Why are there so many things dropped
on the road that you take?

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:45.580 line:93%
Take me next time.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:51.340 line:93%
-Is that right?
-Is what right?

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.090 line:93%
That's right.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.970 line:93%
I found this on the ground too.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.280 line:93%
Take it. My... My arm is getting tired.

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.860 line:93%
You do it.

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:17.950 line:93%
You put it on my finger.

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.660 line:93%
You brat.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:24.960 line:93%
Alright. There.

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:29.170 line:93%
I'm leaving now.

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:31.420 line:93%
I may be late tonight.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:34.430 line:93%
I have a gift for you too.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.520 line:93%
I bought you a pair of sneakers.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.020 line:93%
I have plenty.

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.980 line:93%
The sole ripped, so it leaks.

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:53.150 line:93%
Say, "Thank you," and take them
while I'm being nice.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.450 line:93%
-Weren't they expensive?
-They're counterfeit.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.870 line:93%
Then I'll take them.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.160 line:93%
-Goodness.
-That's right.

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:04.580 line:93%
I have something to say.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.340 line:93%
What is it?

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:15.590 line:93%
No. Later. I'll tell you tonight.

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:18.970 line:93%
-Have a nice day.
-You're so silly.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.850 line:93%
Wait. I really have something to say.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.190 line:93%
What? What is it? The sun is going to set.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:31.650 line:93%
I love you.

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.150 line:93%
You brat. That's stupid...

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.490 line:93%
I'm leaving.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.490 line:93%
Lock up.

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.580 line:93%
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:01.260 line:93%
You'll be getting out soon.

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.850 line:93%
The suffering is finally almost over.

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:08.690 line:93%
Mom didn't come again.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.320 line:93%
It's Saturday. How could she,
with the restaurant?

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:17.440 line:93%
Still, I thought she'd come at least once.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.370 line:93%
We opened another wing,
so it's been even crazier.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.620 line:93%
Be understanding.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.620 line:93%
I understand.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.170 line:93%
Money is more important than her child.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.210 line:93%
She sent her kid to jail to save money
on bail.

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:37.590 line:93%
I understand.

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:39.840 line:93%
It was all for you.

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:42.010 line:93%
That's why she didn't bail you out.

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:45.060 line:93%
That's all an excuse, Dad.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.470 line:93%
It isn't an excuse.

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:51.810 line:93%
She did it so you could grow up
and get your act together.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.400 line:93%
She reported you that day for you too.

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.870 line:93%
Mom was the one who reported me?

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.000 line:93%
Did Mom report me?

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.560 line:93%
How could she do that?

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.700 line:93%
How... How could she...

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:43.780 line:93%
How?

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:48.990 line:93%
She's my mom.

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:52.160 line:93%
How?

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.550 line:93%
I just submitted the petition
for your retrial.

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:13.560 line:93%
You've suffered a lot.

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.270 line:93%
You've suffered a lot, my little brother.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.730 line:93%
No, you've suffered more because of me.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.200 line:93%
-Thank you.
-Don't say that.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:25.780 line:93%
That's ridiculous.

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:31.370 line:93%
I'm sorry I couldn't do it sooner.

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:32.580 line:93%
Don't say that.

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:34.580 line:93%
If it weren't for you...

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.460 line:93%
I may not have been alive today.

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.710 line:93%
Don't say stupid things like that.
Want to die?

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:44.510 line:93%
Sorry.

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:48.970 line:93%
All we did was submit the petition.

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.640 line:93%
It may take months
before we get a response.

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:56.650 line:93%
-I know.
-Don't let it wear you down.

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.190 line:93%
Let's hang in there as we have been.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.950 line:93%
You should return to work.

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:09.780 line:93%
It's been a while, right?

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:14.080 line:93%
We don't know how much longer
this fight will last.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:16.670 line:93%
I'm fine now.

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:21.050 line:93%
I can hang in there,
so return to your university.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.840 line:93%
Leave the work to the lawyer.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:28.800 line:93%
Okay. I'll take care of it.

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:30.140 line:93%
You may get fired.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.760 line:93%
I will not.

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:35.640 line:93%
Why would I get fired?
I'm a popular professor.

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:37.560 line:93%
So, go back to your job.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.650 line:93%
-Okay.
-You mean it?

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:43.320 line:93%
You'll return to work, right?

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.940 line:93%
Then, go back right away.

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:47.320 line:93%
Okay?

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:49.410 line:93%
Promise.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.120 line:93%
Promise.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.290 line:93%
Okay.

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:57.580 line:93%
Okay. Don't worry.

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.630 line:93%
I'll request reinstatement tomorrow.

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:07.010 line:93%
I can finally sleep peacefully now.

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:10.390 line:93%
I can sleep in peace now.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:16.230 line:93%
SEOBU PENITENTIARY

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:33.950 line:93%
-Why do you keep mumbling?
-What?

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:35.740 line:93%
Do you have that much to pray for?

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:40.120 line:93%
If I were God, I'd ignore you
because you're so noisy.

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:41.960 line:93%
You've got mail.

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.430 line:93%
Damn it...

00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:59.640 line:93%
Is it still not over yet?

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.360 line:93%
Is this woman filming <i>Produce 101</i>
or something?

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:06.980 line:93%
Why?

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:09.280 line:93%
How does he know that show?

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.900 line:93%
She says she'll visit today,

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.910 line:93%
and choose then.

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:18.910 line:93%
She'll request a visit with the person
she wants to date.

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.870 line:93%
She's a pro.
She knows how to play the game.

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:26.210 line:93%
She's juggling you two right now.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:27.130 line:93%
Why that...

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.260 line:93%
I'm washing up.

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.020 line:93%
It's a war, you bastard.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.060 line:93%
Let's see who wins.

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.660 line:93%
Hey, Errand Boy! Come here!

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:57.330 line:93%
Hey! Bring me cologne!
Find someone who uses cologne!

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:44.750 line:93%
It's hot.

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.550 line:93%
Damn it...

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.370 line:93%
I'm shocked. Utterly shocked.

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:25.410 line:93%
If you like women and gambling so much,
why did you live in Munrae?

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:27.080 line:93%
My gosh. How amusing.

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:30.290 line:93%
It was hard. It was very hard.

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.460 line:93%
That wasn't the life I dreamed of.

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:36.220 line:93%
What life did you dream of?

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:39.550 line:93%
The life that I dream of...

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:07.790 line:93%
Okay. Let me go over that again.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.830 line:93%
First, you'll have the foie gras salad,

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.460 line:93%
and the filet mignon
with white truffle sauce,

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:15.510 line:93%
both cooked medium rare.

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:17.920 line:93%
What wine would you like?

00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:23.470 line:93%
The Chateau Shubert sauvignon blanc.

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:27.810 line:93%
Pardon?

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:32.190 line:93%
We'll have the Chateau Shubert
sauvignon blanc.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:34.440 line:93%
I don't need to taste it.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:37.650 line:93%
I see. Yes, sir.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.950 line:93%
For dessert,
we have a strawberry chiffon cake

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:43.410 line:93%
and a cinnamon chocolate cake.
Which would you like?

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:45.040 line:93%
I'll take a strawberry chiffon cake.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.330 line:93%
Pardon?

00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:48.210 line:93%
Strawberry chiffon...

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.120 line:93%
The strawberry flavor cake.

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.750 line:93%
Okay, thank you.

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.560 line:93%
I didn't know which you'd like,
so I got you both.

00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:15.400 line:93%
Honey, what is this?

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:18.400 line:93%
What else? They're designer brands.

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:19.610 line:93%
Oh my god. Honey.

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:23.820 line:93%
The black is Chanel,
and the white is... No.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.790 line:93%
The white is Chanel,
and the black is Gucci.

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.500 line:93%
Honey.

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:30.500 line:93%
I love you.

00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.920 line:93%
Shakespeare said,

00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.550 line:93%
"Love is merely a madness."

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:43.590 line:93%
I want to go mad for you today.

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:46.850 line:93%
In light of that,

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:53.020 line:93%
here's to your eyes. Cheers.

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:07.580 line:93%
What a crappy dream. Seriously.

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:13.170 line:93%
Cell 2B6.

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.590 line:93%
Visitation. But let's see. Let's see.

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.430 line:93%
Je-hyeok Kim.

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:28.510 line:93%
No. You don't have a visitor
today either. Sorry.

00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:32.230 line:93%
I feel so bad.

00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:33.690 line:93%
I see.

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:37.230 line:93%
It's okay.

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.190 line:93%
You can call later.

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.610 line:93%
We can make calls tonight.

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:42.650 line:93%
Sure.

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:46.530 line:93%
There is one visitor.

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:55.370 line:93%
Stop stalling!
Are you memorizing it for a test?

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:57.000 line:93%
Are your eyes going dim with old age?

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.590 line:93%
No! Lieutenant Paeng! I'm so sorry!

00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:04.930 line:93%
I was just kidding. It's because
I'm a bit sensitive now. I'm sorry.

00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:08.680 line:93%
-Chul-doo Kang. Visitor.
-Yes!

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:11.890 line:93%
Yes!

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:17.940 line:93%
Yeah, yeah

00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.070 line:93%
You bastard. You baldy bastard.

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:22.150 line:93%
You stay in the cell.

00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:24.900 line:93%
I'll see you later, okay?
I'll see you later.

00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:27.450 line:93%
I'll take care of you all
if things go well.

00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:30.660 line:93%
-I've never seen this name before.
-I'm the hottest guy here.

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.580 line:93%
-Don't come back.
-Okay, fine.

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:02.340 line:93%
What are you doing here?
You didn't say you were coming.

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:09.550 line:93%
It's been a while.

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:12.140 line:93%
Is everything good?

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:14.350 line:93%
Geon-u's well too?

00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:19.100 line:93%
It took you long enough to ask.

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.060 line:93%
You left us for a rich woman.

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.820 line:93%
What are you doing in there?

00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:33.370 line:93%
Geon-u is very sick.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.960 line:93%
Your one and only son...

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:44.880 line:93%
is so sick that he could die any day.

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:48.550 line:93%
What are you talking about?

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:51.130 line:93%
Say that again!

00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:56.060 line:93%
It's liver failure.

00:59:58.350 --> 01:00:00.140 line:93%
It keeps getting worse,

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.560 line:93%
so he needs a liver transplant.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.540 line:93%
My blood type isn't a match,

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:22.750 line:93%
and he's still far down
on the organ transplant waiting list.

01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:26.840 line:93%
Geon-u may end up dying at this rate.

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.220 line:93%
What were you doing?

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:33.180 line:93%
What did you do while he got like that?

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.260 line:93%
I was busy trying to survive.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.690 line:93%
While my gambling husband
lived his life as he pleased,

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:45.230 line:93%
I was busy raising my kid alone!

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.770 line:93%
I was busy trying to survive!

01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:52.110 line:93%
I was too busy working myself to death!

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.250 line:93%
Then how... What...

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.750 line:93%
What... What can I do?

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.550 line:93%
Geon-u said he'd rather die
than get your liver.

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:14.970 line:93%
He says he doesn't want his dad's.

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:23.270 line:93%
Still,

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:26.190 line:93%
I can't let him die like that.

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:33.320 line:93%
At least get a blood test.

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:47.920 line:93%
SEOBU PENITENTIARY

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:06.140 line:93%
NO FOOD OR DRINK

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:07.770 line:93%
CHUL-DOO KANG

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.940 line:93%
<i>Based on the CT, ultrasound, and MRI
of the liver,</i>

01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:15.360 line:93%
<i>the blood vessel shape and function
are all good.</i>

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:18.240 line:93%
<i>The biopsy result will be out soon,</i>

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.530 line:93%
so we can proceed with the surgery
tomorrow afternoon.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.410 line:93%
Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.290 line:93%
Every day was a battle for him.

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:28.750 line:93%
I'm so glad his dad was able
to resolve it so quickly.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.830 line:93%
It's a miracle.

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.630 line:93%
But doctor,

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:37.300 line:93%
you can't tell Geon-u anything
about his dad.

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:39.470 line:93%
He doesn't know.

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:42.970 line:93%
I understand what you mean.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:46.690 line:93%
I've already instructed my staff,
so don't worry.

01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:48.350 line:93%
Thank you.

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:59.160 line:93%
How could this happen?

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.830 line:93%
You never know what will happen to people.

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.410 line:93%
I'm surprised the prison decided
to let him do it this quickly.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.330 line:93%
I thought it would take a while.

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:12.340 line:93%
Did you ask the warden?

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:16.010 line:93%
No.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.680 line:93%
I was going to, but...

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.720 line:93%
He can't get surgery unless he gets
a stay of execution of his sentence.

01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:24.350 line:93%
I'll ask the warden myself.

01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:27.600 line:93%
But just in case, think of a way,
like petitions,

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:30.190 line:93%
or maybe using the media or something.

01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:32.270 line:93%
It's already been decided.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.730 line:93%
The warden submitted a request
to stay his sentence,

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.740 line:93%
and the Prosecutors' Office will give
us an answer by tomorrow.

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:40.610 line:93%
That soon?

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.820 line:93%
There will be a huge article
in the papers tomorrow.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.160 line:93%
"Miraculous Inmate's Organ Donation.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:49.250 line:93%
Seobu Penitentiary
and Seobu Prosecutors' Office

01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:52.710 line:93%
unify and break through
the cold prison wall."

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.590 line:93%
At times like these,
those two work really well together.

01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:01.550 line:93%
Neither has anything to lose.

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:05.390 line:93%
That's great.

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:11.730 line:93%
Je-hyeok.

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:15.320 line:93%
Ji-ho called today.

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:19.740 line:93%
Ji-ho...

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.530 line:93%
has caught the swine flu.

01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:26.120 line:93%
She was very sick.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.410 line:93%
She's hospitalized,

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:31.870 line:93%
which is why she couldn't visit.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.170 line:93%
She said to tell you not to worry.

01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:41.010 line:93%
She's hospitalized because she's sick,

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:46.010 line:93%
but you... She says you!
She says to tell you not to worry.

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:48.720 line:93%
You! She's worried
that you'll get worried,

01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:50.480 line:93%
so she said to tell you not to worry.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.650 line:93%
You'd better worship her
when you get her back, you punk.

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:05.740 line:93%
Come on.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.720 line:93%
His surgery is this afternoon.

01:05:25.550 --> 01:05:27.760 line:93%
That's great. I'm glad.

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:31.770 line:93%
Then, Kaist will get to see his son.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:34.350 line:93%
But the son doesn't know
his dad is the donor.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.860 line:93%
No, after the surgery.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.320 line:93%
I'm sure he'll see him at least once
after surgery.

01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:42.650 line:93%
He'll be at the hospital
for a week or two anyway.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.200 line:93%
Let's focus on the surgery first.

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:47.740 line:93%
After the surgery goes well,

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.740 line:93%
we can think about it then.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.500 line:93%
Mr. Chul-doo Kang.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000 line:93%
NO FOOD OR DRINK

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:04.170 line:93%
Geon-u will be brought into the OR now.

01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:08.760 line:93%
Mr. Kang, you'll go to the OR
about an hour later.

01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:14.140 line:93%
We finished analyzing the blood vessels,
and we have the surgery plan.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.850 line:93%
So, don't worry about a thing.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:19.400 line:93%
You'll just be taking a nice nap.

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:22.900 line:93%
I'll see you in the recovery room.

01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:25.820 line:93%
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:27.360 line:93%
Thank you.

01:06:34.410 --> 01:06:35.710 line:93%
Go to Geon-u.

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:37.540 line:93%
They'll take him down.

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:41.880 line:93%
He's in the ICU, so I can only see him
during visiting hours.

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:44.050 line:93%
I just saw him.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.470 line:93%
That doctor is good, right?

01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:51.800 line:93%
If anything happens to Geon-u,

01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:54.560 line:93%
I won't forgive him.

01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:00.810 line:93%
Mr. Chul-doo Kang.
We're going to do one more brief test.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.950 line:93%
ELEVATOR FULL

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:15.620 line:93%
-Let's take that one. We don't have time.
-Sure.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.290 line:93%
It's crowded, so we'll take
the surgery patients' elevator.

01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:36.600 line:93%
Hello.

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:38.730 line:93%
Hello.

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:56.080 line:93%
CHUL-DOO KANG

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:05.090 line:93%
GEON-U KANG
LIVER FAILURE

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:28.940 line:93%
It's you, Dad, right?

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.530 line:93%
It's you, isn't it, Dad?

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.040 line:93%
I am not.

01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:49.840 line:93%
You have the wrong person.

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:56.550 line:93%
I'm sorry.

01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:12.070 line:93%
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:34.220 line:93%
Geon-u...

01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:45.810 line:93%
Geon-u...

01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:51.070 line:93%
Yes, it's your dad.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.740 line:93%
OPEN REFORM, EMPATHETIC REFORM

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:04.210 line:93%
He was fine a moment ago. Is he faking it?

01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:07.750 line:93%
He threw up three times today.

01:10:09.090 --> 01:10:10.550 line:93%
He hasn't slept in a week.

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.510 line:93%
So, he has insomnia.

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:15.430 line:93%
He can ask for sleeping pills.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.430 line:93%
He won't take any medicine.

01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:23.270 line:93%
He says he's afraid it would make him
crave other drugs.

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:29.730 line:93%
-Aren't you drinking?
-I don't drink sweet coffee.

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:32.230 line:93%
Why is a guy in prison so picky?

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:36.360 line:93%
Dong-ho. Stop cleaning.
Come have some coffee.

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:43.240 line:93%
It's hot.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:45.620 line:93%
Thank you.

01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:53.590 line:93%
Kaist was moved
to a regular hospital room today.

01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:56.170 line:93%
He's eating porridge and exercising now.

01:10:58.130 --> 01:11:00.970 line:93%
Our country's good at surgeries now.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.810 line:93%
He's healthy. They say it went very well.

01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:05.220 line:93%
That's a relief.

01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:07.520 line:93%
It really is a relief. That's great.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.980 line:93%
When will he be discharged?

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:09.980 line:93%
Well...

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:13.820 line:93%
I'd assume a week or two later.
It was a major surgery.

01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:16.400 line:93%
And one bad news.

01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:19.160 line:93%
No visitations again for a while.

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.990 line:93%
The gangster punks got into
a big fight in the yard today.

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.620 line:93%
The ambulance had to come.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.620 line:93%
Visitations and early discharges
are all on halt for the time being.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.190 line:93%
Thank you.

01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:06.790 line:93%
You know...

01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:10.960 line:93%
Can I...

01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:14.710 line:93%
see Geon-u just once?

01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:19.010 line:93%
Let me see him just once.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.160 line:93%
Do you want to die?

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:53.750 line:93%
Okay.

01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:01.970 line:93%
Jung-woo. Thanks for doing the dishes.
I'll do them tomorrow.

01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:05.260 line:93%
It's okay. By the way, it's getting
kind of chilly at night now.

01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.970 line:93%
All right, then.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.770 line:93%
Still, time passes.

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:17.360 line:93%
It's fall already.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.400 line:93%
Gosh.

01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:22.320 line:93%
You must be upset you can't have visitors.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.740 line:93%
This happens now and then.

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:29.450 line:93%
You're not crying, are you?

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.410 line:93%
I'm about to cry.

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:39.380 line:93%
Jung-woo, you never went this long
without seeing your brother before, right?

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:47.890 line:93%
You know, I've never seen brothers

01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:50.510 line:93%
as close as you guys before.

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:56.230 line:93%
I know. Most brothers are apathetic
and don't talk much...

01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:58.900 line:93%
to each other, aren't they?

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:00.480 line:93%
We were like that too.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.940 line:93%
-What?
-That's how we were.

01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:09.870 line:93%
Both my brother and I
aren't very affectionate.

01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:13.700 line:93%
We're 12 years apart,
so we were never close.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.830 line:93%
We probably spoke
fewer than ten times a year.

01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:23.260 line:93%
OCTOBER 2010

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.300 line:93%
Wow. Seaweed soup?

01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:30.390 line:93%
Is it Mom's birthday?

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.520 line:93%
No, it's my birthday.

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:35.940 line:93%
Really?

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:38.980 line:93%
Happy birthday.

01:14:45.650 --> 01:14:48.200 line:93%
Jung-woo is 26 already.

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:50.950 line:93%
Time really flies.

01:14:54.330 --> 01:14:55.160 line:93%
I'm 23.

01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:00.380 line:93%
He's 23.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:08.760 line:93%
SPRING, 2011

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:12.470 line:93%
Jung-woo, take care of yourself.

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:14.270 line:93%
Don't get sick.

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:30.280 line:93%
Train well and call us often.

01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:33.870 line:93%
My baby. It's still so cold out.

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:35.950 line:93%
It's okay, Dad. It's only four weeks.

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.500 line:93%
Don't worry.

01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:49.970 line:93%
Why did you come?

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:54.470 line:93%
I had time to kill.

01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.060 line:93%
Okay.

01:16:17.370 --> 01:16:18.450 line:93%
Take care.

01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:20.250 line:93%
Okay.

01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:28.760 line:93%
<i>He was really stiff.</i>

01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:32.470 line:93%
<i>As soon as my incident happened,</i>

01:16:32.970 --> 01:16:34.970 line:93%
<i>my brother took a leave of absence
from his school.</i>

01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:38.520 line:93%
And from then until now,

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.270 line:93%
he only worked on my case.

01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:44.400 line:93%
He has no personal life.

01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:47.360 line:93%
He spent 24 hours a day on me.

01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:50.360 line:93%
Wow. How nice of him.

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:54.700 line:93%
I never even imagined he'd do that for me.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.030 line:93%
After what happened,

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.080 line:93%
I hated the world.

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:04.420 line:93%
I wanted to kill everyone,

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.590 line:93%
and I wanted to die.

01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:09.050 line:93%
I felt so wronged and was so angry,

01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:11.380 line:93%
it drove me crazy.

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.550 line:93%
-I was out of my mind.
-True.

01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:18.060 line:93%
You really were.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:21.430 line:93%
Aren't you sleeping?

01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:23.270 line:93%
I am.

01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:27.020 line:93%
But...

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.280 line:93%
But once I came to,

01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:32.820 line:93%
we were petitioning for a retrial.

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.320 line:93%
I was just being angry
and annoyed in here,

01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:41.540 line:93%
but I had come this far
thanks to my brother.

01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:48.380 line:93%
Before then, I never thought
I'd actually say things like...

01:17:51.090 --> 01:17:52.300 line:93%
"Thank you,"

01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:54.930 line:93%
or "I love you."

01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:58.600 line:93%
But they come out naturally now
whenever I see him.

01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:01.270 line:93%
It's automatic.

01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:03.770 line:93%
After I came here,

01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:06.100 line:93%
I wrote my sister a letter

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.860 line:93%
for the first time in my life.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.070 line:93%
At lease little sisters are cute.

01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:16.030 line:93%
My sister's temper is just like mine.

01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:20.870 line:93%
We weren't close,
just like you and your brother were.

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:23.700 line:93%
But after what happened,

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:29.080 line:93%
I said a lot of cringy comments
to my sister.

01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:32.670 line:93%
But seriously,

01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:34.800 line:93%
it just comes out automatically.

01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:37.180 line:93%
You guys are lucky.

01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:42.140 line:93%
I'm an only child,
so I have no brothers or sisters.

01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:46.940 line:93%
My mom wanted to save on bail money

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.610 line:93%
and sent her son to jail.

01:18:50.610 --> 01:18:52.360 line:93%
I envy you all.

01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:56.150 line:93%
Didn't your lover report you?

01:18:59.950 --> 01:19:01.700 line:93%
My mom reported me.

01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:07.000 line:93%
My mom is an incredible person.

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.750 line:93%
She's as cold as ice.

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:14.800 line:93%
She's very strong.

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:28.310 line:93%
MASTER YOO'S SPICY SHORTRIBS

01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:40.530 line:93%
I'm a crazy witch.

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:43.120 line:93%
I'm an evil witch.

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.830 line:93%
I was too obsessed with money
to raise my child right.

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.290 line:93%
I...

01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:52.750 line:93%
I deserve to be punished.

01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:55.880 line:93%
My baby.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.840 line:93%
My poor baby. It must be so hard.

01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:04.260 line:93%
How could my baby be in jail?

01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:08.100 line:93%
My poor baby.

01:20:08.890 --> 01:20:10.060 line:93%
The poor thing.

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:34.330 line:93%
You know...

01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:38.630 line:93%
Can I...

01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:41.880 line:93%
see Geon-u just once?

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.430 line:93%
Let me see him just once.

01:20:49.810 --> 01:20:53.600 line:93%
Actually, I already asked him.

01:20:53.690 --> 01:20:56.230 line:93%
You did? When is he coming?

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:03.610 line:93%
He said he didn't want to see you.

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:07.620 line:93%
He knew it was you.

01:21:08.410 --> 01:21:10.410 line:93%
He said he knew.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.040 line:93%
Yes. That's why he should come see me.

01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:16.960 line:93%
He said he would never.
Over his dead body.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.510 line:93%
He said he hates...

01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:24.890 line:93%
having an ex-con father.

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:29.680 line:93%
He'd be fine with a dad...

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.770 line:93%
who collects trash on the street, but...

01:21:36.190 --> 01:21:37.820 line:93%
not a dad in jail.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.900 line:93%
He says it makes him sick.

01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:47.700 line:93%
I even gave him my liver.

01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:53.540 line:93%
I even gave him my liver.
Why does he hate me?

01:21:54.710 --> 01:21:56.290 line:93%
That punk...

01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:58.630 line:93%
He shouldn't be like that.

01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:00.380 line:93%
Exactly.

01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:05.470 line:93%
You idiot.

01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:09.640 line:93%
You should've done better.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.680 line:93%
You should've...

01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:14.940 line:93%
You should've been a better person.

01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:18.060 line:93%
You're being punished.

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.690 line:93%
You abandoned your child...

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:24.780 line:93%
You abandoned your wife
and did as you pleased!

01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:27.160 line:93%
You're being punished for it!

01:22:28.570 --> 01:22:31.290 line:93%
My gosh! Thank you!

01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:34.200 line:93%
My gosh! Thank you, Lord!

01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:40.170 line:93%
What are you doing?

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.500 line:93%
What are you doing?

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:45.010 line:93%
I'm just going to see Geon-u's face,
just once.

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:46.380 line:93%
Where is he? What room number?

01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:48.930 line:93%
He doesn't want to see you.
What's wrong with you?

01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:50.550 line:93%
Yeah, so his dad...

01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:54.680 line:93%
I gave him my liver. Why does he hate me?

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:57.520 line:93%
Stop lying. You're being ridiculous.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.440 line:93%
-Geon-u doesn't want to see you!
-Let go.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.980 line:93%
Let go!

01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:04.690 line:93%
Where's Geon-u? What room number? Tell me.

01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:07.110 line:93%
-Geon-u Kang.
-I'm sorry.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.410 line:93%
Forget it. Let go.

01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:09.950 line:93%
Let go!

01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:12.410 line:93%
I said to let go!

01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:15.500 line:93%
Let go! I need... Look, I...

01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:18.790 line:93%
I... I need to go...

01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:21.250 line:93%
I need to go see my kid.

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.500 line:93%
Why won't you let me go?

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.940 line:93%
Hey, Geon-u! You bastard.

01:23:44.610 --> 01:23:47.950 line:93%
TEN DAYS LATER

01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:00.250 line:93%
Let's clean up.

01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:02.000 line:93%
Jung-woo, wash the rags.

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:04.630 line:93%
Is he coming today?

01:24:05.210 --> 01:24:06.840 line:93%
Is Kaist coming?

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.130 line:93%
He's being discharged today.

01:24:24.730 --> 01:24:26.690 line:93%
You may have visitors again
starting tomorrow.

01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:27.940 line:93%
Prepare for your labor.

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:32.320 line:93%
-Is Lieutenant Paeng away?
-What about Officer Song?

01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:34.410 line:93%
They both went out of town for training.

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:35.700 line:93%
They'll be back in ten days.

01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:39.830 line:93%
Okay.

01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:47.050 line:93%
Take care of yourself.

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.060 line:93%
They said you have to change into this.

01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.990 line:93%
Tell Geon-u...

01:25:15.570 --> 01:25:17.660 line:93%
that his dad loves him a lot.

01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:22.120 line:93%
Okay.

01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:29.880 line:93%
You must be upset you couldn't see him.

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:34.930 line:93%
No, I'm fine.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.220 line:93%
I saw him in my dream last night.

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:41.270 line:93%
He was in your dream?

01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:43.890 line:93%
In my dream...

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.730 line:93%
Geon-u and I...

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.740 line:93%
We ate something yummy at a nice place.

01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:59.330 line:93%
What, did you have steak?

01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:05.290 line:93%
We had super expensive steak

01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:07.750 line:93%
at a super expensive restaurant.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.540 line:93%
Dad, I'm hungry.

01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:51.840 line:93%
Where's Mom? Isn't she home?

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.380 line:93%
She went to the restaurant.

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:56.380 line:93%
Find something to eat in the fridge.

01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:58.720 line:93%
I'm sleeping. Don't wake me up.

01:27:05.850 --> 01:27:06.850 line:93%
God...

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.320 line:93%
Let's eat. Eat.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.700 line:93%
Doesn't it look yummy?

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.780 line:93%
This is Dad's specialty instant noodles.

01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:21.870 line:93%
There are three boiled eggs in there too.

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:30.330 line:93%
What's wrong with that? Did it break?

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.710 line:93%
It's been a while since it broke.

01:27:33.090 --> 01:27:35.800 line:93%
I asked Mom for a new one,
but she flat-out told me no.

01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:07.870 line:93%
Okay.

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.960 line:93%
-You're awesome.
-Of course.

01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:13.880 line:93%
This is a piece of cake.
This is nothing to me.

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.380 line:93%
We submitted our future
career goals in school today.

01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:18.920 line:93%
-I'm going to change it tomorrow.
-To what?

01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:20.380 line:93%
To someone like you.

01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:23.180 line:93%
Someone like me? What's that?

01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.220 line:93%
A scientist.

01:28:25.890 --> 01:28:27.310 line:93%
You're a scientist.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.890 line:93%
Sure. I'm a famous scientist in Munrae.

01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:32.810 line:93%
If I wanted,

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:36.980 line:93%
I could make Taekwon V, Gundam,
Grandizer, anything.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.120 line:93%
-Hello?
-Get over here, punk.

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.950 line:93%
Why aren't you here? A house opened up.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:52.460 line:93%
Okay. I'm coming. I'll go now.

01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:57.300 line:93%
I'll be back.

01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:03.390 line:93%
Son.

01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:06.470 line:93%
Later, for dinner,

01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:10.930 line:93%
order yourself some <i>jjajangmyeon</i>, okay?

01:29:32.330 --> 01:29:34.920 line:93%
Are you ready? Let's go.

01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:43.880 line:93%
Officer, can you put the cuffs on me
after we leave the hospital,

01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:46.340 line:93%
in the van?

01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:49.850 line:93%
My son is in the same hospital wing,

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:53.770 line:93%
and I don't want him to see me.

01:29:59.190 --> 01:30:00.190 line:93%
It's the rule.

01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:10.200 line:93%
Oh, right.

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.160 line:93%
You will be transferred
to Nambu Penitentiary as of today.

01:30:15.670 --> 01:30:17.750 line:93%
It's new, so it has the best facilities.

01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:20.170 line:93%
You're going to the medical wing there.

01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:30.140 line:93%
So, stop cleaning,

01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:32.470 line:93%
and get ready for work.
We don't have time.

01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:35.440 line:93%
How could they transfer him
out of the blue like that?

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.310 line:93%
His things are still here.

01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:42.150 line:93%
-How could they...
-Why you...

01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:45.200 line:93%
What are you talking about?

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:49.160 line:93%
You people are here
because you committed crimes.

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:51.030 line:93%
You guys are criminals.

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.410 line:93%
Why must we report things like that
to jerks like you?

01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:59.830 line:93%
The rules prevent us
from telling you, too.

01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:03.840 line:93%
If you want to assert rights like that,
don't commit crimes.

01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:09.010 line:93%
This isn't a club.

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.720 line:93%
Wake the hell up.

01:31:12.890 --> 01:31:14.140 line:93%
This is a prison.

01:31:40.210 --> 01:31:46.260 line:93%
PERSONAL EFFECTS

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:58.140 line:93%

You were selected
to be released on parole!

01:32:20.210 --> 01:32:22.330 line:93%
Your name will be sent
to the Ministry of Justice soon.

01:32:23.290 --> 01:32:25.090 line:93%
-Do you mean it?
-Of course.

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.630 line:93%
Don't worry. You'll pass, no problem.

01:32:29.130 --> 01:32:31.430 line:93%
You're a model inmate,
have crazy merit points,

01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:34.800 line:93%
and got good officer evaluations.
There's no reason for you not to pass.

01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:39.890 line:93%
Gosh. You really hung in there. Good job.

01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:44.190 line:93%
How many years was that?

01:32:46.190 --> 01:32:47.480 line:93%
It's been over 22 years, right?

01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:25.190 line:93%
<i>He said something harsh.</i>

01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:26.310 line:93%
<i>His feelings were hurt.</i>

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.270 line:93%
<i>What did he say?</i>

01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:32.740 line:93%
<i>Even if everyone else thinks that,
you can't.</i>

01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:36.620 line:93%
<i>They're the worst. They'll go after anyone
if they smell money.</i>

01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:39.160 line:93%
I know that jerk.

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:41.870 line:93%
<i>-The guards are there.
-You know what this is, right?</i>

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:44.170 line:93%
<i>Stay still. It's what you like.</i>

01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:46.330 line:93%
<i>-Who likes druggies?
-Three. Two.</i>

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:47.840 line:93%
<i>-One.</i>
-Shit.

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:50.550 line:93%
<i>-Do you hate me too?
-Wake up!</i>

01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:52.800 line:93%
<i>You need to be alert!</i>

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:54.340 line:93%
<i>He's so happy.</i>

01:33:55.260 --> 01:34:00.220 line:93%

<i>Currently serving his 22nd year.</i>

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:05.730 line:93%
<i>You're scaring me.</i>

01:34:05.810 --> 01:34:07.060 line:93%
Are you stupid?

No, right? There aren't any, is there?

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:10.360 line:93%
<i>There is.</i>

01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:12.360 line:93%

01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:15.110 line:93%
<i>-Of all the...
-Gosh.</i>

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.700 line:93%
