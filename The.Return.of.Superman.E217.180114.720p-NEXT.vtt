00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:15.430 line:93%
Are you all done?

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.831 line:93%
The yogurt too.

00:07:21.101 --> 00:07:22.870 line:93%
That goes into the trash can.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.000 line:93%
All right.

00:07:26.911 --> 00:07:28.671 line:93%
No, this goes here.

00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:31.240 line:93%
(Lastly, they turn in the tray.)

00:07:32.341 --> 00:07:33.851 line:93%
Good job, kids.

00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:36.781 line:93%
Seo Jun didn't finish his food.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.680 line:93%
Despite incidents, the twins successfully...

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.190 line:93%
ate lunch at the school cafeteria.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.021 line:93%
(It's time for dad to arrive.)

00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:45.161 line:93%
Did you have fun?

00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:46.661 line:93%
- Yes. Daddy. - Yes?

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.231 line:93%
We already ate.

00:07:49.231 --> 00:07:50.231 line:93%
Where's my food?

00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:51.700 line:93%
We don't have any.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.831 line:93%
We ate with these girls.

00:07:57.541 --> 00:07:58.570 line:93%
Where's your pants?

00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.901 line:93%
Look.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.810 line:93%
Well, the pants...

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.911 line:93%
Daddy, look behind him.

00:08:08.281 --> 00:08:09.281 line:93%
What is that?

00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:11.120 line:93%
- It's not poop. - It's chocolate.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.680 line:93%
- It's chocolate. - Where's your pants?

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.221 line:93%
Chocolate got on his pants.

00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:16.961 line:93%
The pants are right here.

00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:18.060 line:93%
You should wear...

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.961 line:93%
(My goodness)

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.260 line:93%
You walked around like this?

00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:24.601 line:93%
Yes.

00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:26.560 line:93%
My goodness.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.930 line:93%
Hurry and wear it. Backwards is fine.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.870 line:93%
You'll get into trouble.

00:08:31.271 --> 00:08:32.800 line:93%
All right. Let's hurry and go.

00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:35.470 line:93%
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.011 line:93%
Have a great day.

00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:42.050 line:93%
Where is this place with bright neon lights...

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.421 line:93%
and exciting music?

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.090 line:93%
It's a 70s and 80s-themed roller skating rink.

00:08:47.891 --> 00:08:50.190 line:93%
I guess they still exist.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.531 line:93%
Which family is here to play today?

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.031 line:93%
There were roller skating rinks when...

00:08:57.031 --> 00:08:58.060 line:93%
I was in elementary school.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.730 line:93%
I went a few times, although not often.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.001 line:93%
I heard that bullies would steal money...

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.440 line:93%
from kids there.

00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:08.710 line:93%
I remember them being places for juvenile crime.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.980 line:93%
Je Si and Je A visited a roller skating rink.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.911 line:93%
They said that it was fun.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.251 line:93%
I took Seol A, Soo A, and Si An.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.921 line:93%
It was good to reminisce as well.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.450 line:93%
(He's back to the fashion of his youth.)

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.651 line:93%
They walk back memory lane.

00:09:21.651 --> 00:09:24.121 line:93%
Dong Kook transforms into that cool senior.

00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:26.361 line:93%
(Dong Kook, the best face in town)

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.661 line:93%
Soo A has turned into a prim girl.

00:09:32.661 --> 00:09:33.930 line:93%
(Soo A, the prim girl)

00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:38.501 line:93%
(Grinning)

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.340 line:93%
Seol A is now an exuberant tomboy.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.710 line:93%
And just for today, Si An can look...

00:09:46.781 --> 00:09:48.611 line:93%
a bit older than his usual self.

00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:53.021 line:93%
You guys remind me of 80s college students.

00:09:53.391 --> 00:09:54.850 line:93%
Should we go for a spin?

00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:56.320 line:93%
All right.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.421 line:93%
Lower your waist.

00:09:58.421 --> 00:09:59.891 line:93%
(A senior guides him.)

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:01.190 line:93%
Move your legs.

00:10:01.991 --> 00:10:03.300 line:93%
There you go. Good.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.230 line:93%
Push through. Good. Push.

00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:08.800 line:93%
Stand up. Here we go.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.200 line:93%
1, 2. There you go.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.840 line:93%
(His posture is stable.)

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.411 line:93%
You're good, Si An.

00:10:17.411 --> 00:10:20.050 line:93%
(Si An is pretty good.)

00:10:23.921 --> 00:10:25.320 line:93%
Look at me, Si An.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.391 line:93%
Good job.

00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:29.521 line:93%
Look over there too. Good.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.320 line:93%
Wave your hand. Good.

00:10:34.131 --> 00:10:36.430 line:93%
Just standing like that is a skill too.

00:10:36.491 --> 00:10:37.800 line:93%
Try tip-toeing.

00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:40.671 line:93%
If you stand like this, you won't fall.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.930 line:93%
Like this.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.741 line:93%
Just stay like that, okay?

00:10:45.371 --> 00:10:47.011 line:93%
You won't fall. Oh, no.

00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:48.840 line:93%
(Falling)

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.381 line:93%
(Crying)

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.651 line:93%
You were bad, daddy.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.480 line:93%
Look at Seol A go. Oh, no.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.820 line:93%
(She's struggling too.)

00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:01.690 line:93%
(I guess I'm not alone.)

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.791 line:93%
- Lower your waist. - Yes, move your legs.

00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:05.761 line:93%
Good job. You're good at this.

00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:08.661 line:93%
(Falling)

00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:11.060 line:93%
Daddy, I can do this alone.

00:11:11.401 --> 00:11:12.761 line:93%
Oh, no.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.241 line:93%
(Unintentional slapstick comedy)

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.700 line:93%
(Struggling)

00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:23.011 line:93%
Find your center of...

00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:25.881 line:93%
(She gets right back up after 7th attempt.)

00:11:25.881 --> 00:11:28.411 line:93%
Try again. Move forward.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.050 line:93%
(Falling)

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.251 line:93%
No, don't sit. Oh, no.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.991 line:93%
- This doesn't hurt. - Okay, then get up.

00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:38.891 line:93%
(I should demonstrate.)

00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:41.391 line:93%
It's a bit hard, right?

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.661 line:93%
- Yes. - It's hard, right?

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.861 line:93%
Look at me.

00:11:45.131 --> 00:11:47.330 line:93%
Move slowly and push forward.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.340 line:93%
It just rolls forward. Take it slowly.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.300 line:93%
(Tip-toeing carefully)

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.411 line:93%
I thought he said that he's been before?

00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:57.210 line:93%
He's not much different from the children.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.480 line:93%
(Waddling)

00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:00.850 line:93%
At first, you have to...

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.921 line:93%
(On the field, he's the king of lions.)

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.050 line:93%
I remember being able to ride as a child.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.820 line:93%
His reputation as a lion isn't helping him today.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.460 line:93%
They're very good.

00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:19.730 line:93%
I used to stop by going backwards.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.200 line:93%
(What's going on? Daddy is worse than me.)

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.371 line:93%
Kids, they take song requests.

00:12:24.901 --> 00:12:26.401 line:93%
What do you want to listen to?

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.371 line:93%
The songs you used to listen to long ago.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.080 line:93%
Okay. Please play music from back in the day.

00:12:33.141 --> 00:12:35.350 line:93%
- How about "Sunny"? - Yes, that sounds good.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.521 line:93%
Please turn on the music.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.850 line:93%
Music, cue.

00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:45.261 line:93%
(Do you remember those fresher days?)

00:12:45.261 --> 00:12:47.491 line:93%
It used to be popular. This is the dance.

00:12:47.491 --> 00:12:49.060 line:93%
(Things brings back memories.)

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.830 line:93%
(It's a retro dance party.)

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.671 line:93%
The trio dances along to disco music.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.371 line:93%
(Bask in the music.)

00:12:59.671 --> 00:13:00.970 line:93%
He's quite the dancer.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.541 line:93%
Poke the air.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.850 line:93%
(I'm the best dancer here.)

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.781 line:93%
You guys will really like clubs.

00:13:11.781 --> 00:13:13.421 line:93%
(They all dance up a frenzy.)

00:13:13.991 --> 00:13:16.891 line:93%
(Excited, Dong Kook lets loose.)

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.891 line:93%
(Sliding)

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.090 line:93%
(It's a perfect slide.)

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.671 line:93%
(He always copies his sister.)

00:13:27.631 --> 00:13:30.470 line:93%
(How was it? Aren't I something?)

00:13:31.141 --> 00:13:32.541 line:93%
Do you have "Macarena"?

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.210 line:93%
Let's try this. Line up.

00:13:38.241 --> 00:13:40.651 line:93%
(He rides the rhythm first with his finger.)

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.950 line:93%
(What song is this?)

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:43.950 line:93%
Poke your hands.

00:13:46.891 --> 00:13:48.690 line:93%
I know this song too.

00:13:48.891 --> 00:13:50.761 line:93%
We danced along a lot to this too.

00:13:50.991 --> 00:13:55.161 line:93%
(Back then, you were odd if you didn't know it.)

00:13:56.631 --> 00:14:00.930 line:93%
(Macarena fervor was strong in Korea.)

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.470 line:93%
(When it comes on, you can't help but dance.)

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.810 line:93%
Okay.

00:14:10.411 --> 00:14:11.411 line:93%
Do the wave.

00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:14.151 line:93%
(The key point is the hip waves.)

00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:19.050 line:93%
(The dance has become muscle memory.)

00:14:22.021 --> 00:14:23.460 line:93%
(Whirling together)

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.560 line:93%
You're good, Si An.

00:14:25.891 --> 00:14:26.891 line:93%
You're all good.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.300 line:93%
(The next song is "YMCA".)

00:14:36.741 --> 00:14:39.800 line:93%
(Everyone clap together.)

00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:42.041 line:93%
Young man.

00:14:45.241 --> 00:14:47.611 line:93%
(He shakes his legs.)

00:14:48.781 --> 00:14:52.151 line:93%
(Dong Kook passionately leads them.)

00:14:53.251 --> 00:14:55.950 line:93%
- Y, - M, C,

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.121 line:93%
- and A. - A.

00:14:58.861 --> 00:15:04.200 line:93%
(His movements are slow.)

00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:06.671 line:93%
Gosh. I'm hot.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.330 line:93%
- I want water. - You want water?

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.470 line:93%
Okay. Let's go. Let's go eat.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.340 line:93%
Daddy, is that sausage yours?

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.810 line:93%
Yes, it is.

00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:22.411 line:93%
I always made you cry by eating too much, right?

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.320 line:93%
So, I'm giving you a chance.

00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:27.151 line:93%
You can eat as much as you want first...

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.590 line:93%
(It'll start with you.)

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.720 line:93%
Then Soo A, Seol A, then myself.

00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:36.600 line:93%
Si An always just ended up with the leftovers.

00:15:36.761 --> 00:15:37.960 line:93%
You first, Si An.

00:15:38.131 --> 00:15:40.871 line:93%
Eat as much as you can first, okay?

00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:43.440 line:93%
Oh, this can spin.

00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:48.271 line:93%
Is that it? Then, it's Soo A.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.310 line:93%
She can sure eat more.

00:15:57.621 --> 00:16:01.891 line:93%
(She takes the bite down to her throat.)

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:04.761 line:93%
This is all mine, right?

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.421 line:93%
All right.

00:16:07.361 --> 00:16:10.631 line:93%
(Daddy, you know it has to come around, right?)

00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:14.001 line:93%
- No. - All right.

00:16:14.671 --> 00:16:15.970 line:93%
Now, it's Si An's turn.

00:16:16.771 --> 00:16:18.141 line:93%
It's yours Si An.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.371 line:93%
Then, it's going to be Soo A and Seol A.

00:16:21.641 --> 00:16:24.911 line:93%
But you can eat as much as you want.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.751 line:93%
(With one bite,)

00:16:27.751 --> 00:16:30.251 line:93%
(he makes a clean finish.)

00:16:30.251 --> 00:16:32.151 line:93%
You ate it all?

00:16:33.491 --> 00:16:35.121 line:93%
Soo A and Seol A can't have any now.

00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:37.720 line:93%
(That's right.)

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.791 line:93%
(He just feels sorry.)

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:42.690 line:93%
- It's okay. - Is it?

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.830 line:93%
You always get upset when I eat.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.100 line:93%
But Si An is okay?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.200 line:93%
Yes.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.470 line:93%
(Si An always got the short end of the stick.)

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.741 line:93%
There's another one. But I'll start this time.

00:16:53.171 --> 00:16:54.911 line:93%
Gosh. What's that?

00:16:55.141 --> 00:16:57.710 line:93%
(He exchanges it for an empty skewer.)

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.450 line:93%
- What's what? - A baby is riding.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.480 line:93%
Hey, but...

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.621 line:93%
(He pretends to have eaten it all.)

00:17:07.921 --> 00:17:09.391 line:93%
It's my turn, but I ate it all.

00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:13.361 line:93%
(What? You ate it all?)

00:17:13.361 --> 00:17:16.061 line:93%
All right. Okay. Why are you trying to cry?

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.000 line:93%
You don't understand what's...

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.301 line:93%
going on, right, Si An?

00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:23.171 line:93%
Why did you not save some for Soo A?

00:17:23.171 --> 00:17:26.071 line:93%
(Si An got Dong Kook totally fooled.)

00:17:27.871 --> 00:17:29.841 line:93%
Hey, just eat yours.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.641 line:93%
It’s not your turn anyway. Okay, I'm sorry.

00:17:33.881 --> 00:17:35.611 line:93%
Here it is.

00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:39.621 line:93%
- You hid the real one. - I was joking around.

00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:41.821 line:93%
- You switched it. - While you looked away,

00:17:41.821 --> 00:17:43.661 line:93%
I switched it with the skewer.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.561 line:93%
Look over there.

00:17:48.131 --> 00:17:50.200 line:93%
Did he get caught red-handed?

00:17:50.831 --> 00:17:52.000 line:93%
Look over there.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.131 line:93%
Or will they be fooled again this time?

00:17:55.131 --> 00:17:56.571 line:93%
(He got caught.)

00:17:57.141 --> 00:17:58.440 line:93%
You switched it.

00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:04.440 line:93%
She knows it's her turn.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.051 line:93%
You'll remember this later whenever you eat sausages.

00:18:10.121 --> 00:18:12.651 line:93%
Once you start chewing gum,

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.990 line:93%
it's a done deal here. Who wants gum?

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.051 line:93%
I do.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.891 line:93%
Pass it down to your sisters.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.230 line:93%
- Me too. - Pass it down.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.700 line:93%
Pass it to Seol A.

00:18:28.131 --> 00:18:29.171 line:93%
How about mine?

00:18:31.071 --> 00:18:33.141 line:93%
(He leaves Si An out and chews one himself.)

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.680 line:93%
Dong Kook just can't help himself.

00:18:41.051 --> 00:18:44.151 line:93%
How about me? Why don't I get one?

00:18:44.881 --> 00:18:46.891 line:93%
Do you want one?

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.851 line:93%
Show me some bravado.

00:18:51.821 --> 00:18:53.631 line:93%
(Shimmying)

00:18:53.631 --> 00:18:56.061 line:93%
Thunder power.

00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:01.700 line:93%
(It's so hard to get a stick of gum.)

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.341 line:93%
Don't swallow it, Si An.

00:19:04.401 --> 00:19:05.401 line:93%
You won't, right?

00:19:06.101 --> 00:19:09.980 line:93%
(Si An enjoys the gum with a happy expression.)

00:19:11.841 --> 00:19:13.111 line:93%
How do you chew gum, Seol A?

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.510 line:93%
There you go. Look at her.

00:19:16.881 --> 00:19:18.180 line:93%
When I was in elementary school,

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.520 line:93%
I couldn't go because of girls like you.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.051 line:93%
They'd steal my money.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.990 line:93%
You have to show your teeth.

00:19:24.591 --> 00:19:26.020 line:93%
(She seems to have chewed a lot of gum.)

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.190 line:93%
Looks like you've been chewing.

00:19:27.891 --> 00:19:31.061 line:93%
Seol A has a different aura.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.270 line:93%
That's because I'm the oldest.

00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:38.841 line:93%
(The Ko duo are going somewhere.)

00:19:38.841 --> 00:19:41.671 line:93%
Something serious seems to have happened.

00:19:42.411 --> 00:19:43.740 line:93%
What will it be all about?

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.411 line:93%
(Sighing)

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.611 line:93%
- Hey, can you do well? - Yes.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.921 line:93%
Be confident, okay?

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.290 line:93%
With confidence.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.621 line:93%
- With a loud voice. - A loud voice.

00:19:55.621 --> 00:19:56.960 line:93%
Shall we try calling mom?

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.621 line:93%
(They call Yang Im.)

00:19:58.621 --> 00:20:00.230 line:93%
- Hello? - Hello?

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.631 line:93%
- Are you on your way? - Yes.

00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:06.401 line:93%
How can you not come after applying for it?

00:20:07.601 --> 00:20:10.171 line:93%
Something came up.

00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:11.641 line:93%
You can do well, right, Seung Jae?

00:20:12.071 --> 00:20:13.371 line:93%
I'm going to be first.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.740 line:93%
- You're the best. - I'm going to be first.

00:20:17.881 --> 00:20:19.740 line:93%
Gosh. I'm nervous.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.351 line:93%
- Hi-five. - Hi-five.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.551 line:93%
Where is the Ko duo heading so nervously?

00:20:26.551 --> 00:20:28.220 line:93%
(Where are they going?)

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.020 line:93%
(It's a photo zone.)

00:20:33.661 --> 00:20:35.561 line:93%
Seung Jae, it's a photo zone.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.161 line:93%
An "I'm Proud-of-my-dad" contest?

00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:41.430 line:93%
"I'm Proud-of-my-dad" Contest.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.200 line:93%
(Chuckling)

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.000 line:93%
My wife signed up Seung Jae for...

00:20:45.071 --> 00:20:47.071 line:93%
the contest.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.381 line:93%
I saw her rehearsing with him.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.051 line:93%
There were a lot of "not's" in the lyrics.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.421 line:93%
(When I don't think about dad, I don't cry)

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.331 line:93%
(The person who is not good in the world is Dad)

00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:10.601 line:93%
(I love you not)

00:21:10.601 --> 00:21:12.161 line:93%
(He likes doing everything the opposite way.)

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.430 line:93%
You will boast about Dad,

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.171 line:93%
not criticize Dad.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.740 line:93%
Okay, Dad.

00:21:18.801 --> 00:21:21.641 line:93%
Don't say, "He drinks and eats ramyeon."

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.071 line:93%
- Okay? - Okay.

00:21:23.411 --> 00:21:25.341 line:93%
I will be the winner.

00:21:25.341 --> 00:21:26.811 line:93%
The winner! Thumbs up.

00:21:26.811 --> 00:21:28.510 line:93%
- Okay. - The winner!

00:21:29.551 --> 00:21:32.450 line:93%
They even took a photo in hopes they’ll win.

00:21:32.821 --> 00:21:34.391 line:93%
Will Seung Jae be able to do well?

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.161 line:93%
Other teams are rehearsing.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.030 line:93%
Why don't we practice on the stage?

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.591 line:93%
Let's go up the stage and practice.

00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:43.960 line:93%
Okay, let's do that. Here are the footprints.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.000 line:93%
Stand on these footprints.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.930 line:93%
Okay. On these?

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.301 line:93%
(The stage is bigger than they expected.)

00:21:51.141 --> 00:21:52.700 line:93%
(Will Seung Jae be able to do well?)

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.940 line:93%
Hello.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.141 line:93%
(Cheerful)

00:21:55.611 --> 00:21:56.611 line:93%
Hello.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.611 line:93%
(He is like Song Hae.)

00:21:58.611 --> 00:22:01.450 line:93%
I am Ko Seung Jae from Bangbae-dong.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.421 line:93%
(My goodness.)

00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:05.421 line:93%
(He is cute.)

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.690 line:93%
Aren't you nervous?

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.651 line:93%
20 years ago,

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.361 line:93%
I went up the stage countless times.

00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:15.361 line:93%
(He ruled the stage with his dance.)

00:22:15.361 --> 00:22:18.930 line:93%
(He is an expert when it comes to stages.)

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.571 line:93%
- Do you want some tips? - Yes.

00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:25.371 line:93%
Firstly, smile.

00:22:25.641 --> 00:22:27.411 line:93%
Smile. Smile always. Give me a big smile.

00:22:28.141 --> 00:22:29.411 line:93%
If you do that...

00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:30.411 line:93%
(Laughing)

00:22:30.411 --> 00:22:32.440 line:93%
I am not telling you to laugh.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.081 line:93%
You need to have a smile on your face.

00:22:34.611 --> 00:22:37.121 line:93%
(He does his best to control his laughter.)

00:22:37.821 --> 00:22:39.720 line:93%
Make sure you say hello.

00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:40.851 line:93%
Hello.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:42.591 line:93%
Be polite.

00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:45.460 line:93%
(He roams the stage.)

00:22:45.591 --> 00:22:48.891 line:93%
It's a microphone.

00:22:49.831 --> 00:22:51.061 line:93%
Children.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.770 line:93%
(You are the youngest one in this room.)

00:22:54.571 --> 00:22:57.671 line:93%
My dad is tall.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.040 line:93%
My dad plays well with me.

00:23:01.111 --> 00:23:02.111 line:93%
Go on.

00:23:02.111 --> 00:23:04.180 line:93%
My dad drinks.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:06.750 line:93%
Good luck!

00:23:07.651 --> 00:23:08.651 line:93%
Thank you.

00:23:08.651 --> 00:23:09.851 line:93%
(I am Ko Seung Jae.)

00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:12.121 line:93%
I am Ko Seung Jae.

00:23:12.881 --> 00:23:15.351 line:93%
(The seats fill up.)

00:23:15.351 --> 00:23:16.921 line:93%
(Seung Jae takes a seat.)

00:23:16.921 --> 00:23:19.220 line:93%
- You are so cute! - Say, "Hello."

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.490 line:93%
- Hi. - Hello.

00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:22.490 line:93%
Say hello.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:23.831 line:93%
Hi.

00:23:23.831 --> 00:23:25.361 line:93%
(His attention is on the younger girl.)

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:19.281 line:93%
You don't want to be bald.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.310 line:93%
All right. I won't say more.

00:40:21.611 --> 00:40:23.321 line:93%
Please go to your room.

00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:26.421 line:93%
You will learn how to draw a bath for a newborn.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.190 line:93%
Okay. Thank you.

00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:30.020 line:93%
William.

00:40:31.321 --> 00:40:32.390 line:93%
William.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.690 line:93%
- Who is that? - Did you miss me?

00:40:33.991 --> 00:40:36.261 line:93%
How cute!

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.960 line:93%
Thank you.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.301 line:93%
William, did you eat?

00:40:42.071 --> 00:40:43.071 line:93%
(No, I am hungry.)

00:40:43.071 --> 00:40:44.401 line:93%
It doesn't look like he did.

00:40:44.901 --> 00:40:47.511 line:93%
- We had breakfast. - Why does he look shabby?

00:40:47.671 --> 00:40:51.241 line:93%
(He asks for food as soon as he sees Mom.)

00:40:51.241 --> 00:40:52.710 line:93%
Food.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.881 line:93%
Do you want me to feed you?

00:40:56.511 --> 00:40:57.750 line:93%
Do you want to sit on the bed?

00:40:58.421 --> 00:40:59.620 line:93%
Do you want to sit here?

00:40:59.651 --> 00:41:03.091 line:93%
(I like it here the best.)

00:41:03.151 --> 00:41:05.060 line:93%
William, is it good?

00:41:07.761 --> 00:41:09.660 line:93%
At the rooftop... Come in.

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:12.830 line:93%
Hello. Ben is here.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:13.901 line:93%
The baby is here.

00:41:16.131 --> 00:41:17.770 line:93%
Ben is here.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.870 line:93%
The baby is here.

00:41:22.071 --> 00:41:24.181 line:93%
(Yawning)

00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:25.681 line:93%
- Ben. - Hello, Ben.

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:31.821 line:93%
Ben, who couldn't open his eyes at first,

00:41:31.951 --> 00:41:34.451 line:93%
grew up with his family's love.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.560 line:93%
(Is my brother here?)

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.861 line:93%
(Running over)

00:41:42.861 --> 00:41:44.160 line:93%
Baby.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.100 line:93%
- Ben. - My goodness.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:52.440 line:93%
(He is cute.)

00:41:53.571 --> 00:41:56.111 line:93%
(Thank you, William.)

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:00.480 line:93%
Bentley.

00:42:01.511 --> 00:42:02.850 line:93%
Bentley.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:04.281 line:93%
(Bentley's head follows Sam's voice.)

00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:06.991 line:93%
- Bentley. - He reacts to his name.

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:11.060 line:93%
Whose voice is that?

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:15.031 line:93%
(Is that Dad's voice?)

00:42:15.031 --> 00:42:16.931 line:93%
Now, Ben will take...

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.060 line:93%
a bath.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.131 line:93%
The umbilical cord stump hasn't fallen off,

00:42:21.131 --> 00:42:23.201 line:93%
so we will only clean...

00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:24.971 line:93%
- his face and butt. - Okay.

00:42:24.971 --> 00:42:28.071 line:93%
When you give bath to a baby,

00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:30.111 line:93%
you need to sit in a comfortable position.

00:42:30.111 --> 00:42:33.381 line:93%
With your thumb and forefinger,

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:34.881 line:93%
cover his ears.

00:42:35.951 --> 00:42:37.181 line:93%
Eyes.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.051 line:93%
Rub them gently.

00:42:40.051 --> 00:42:43.020 line:93%
(Wipe the baby's eyes, nose, and mouth.)

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.120 line:93%
Like this.

00:42:45.721 --> 00:42:46.991 line:93%
(Watching carefully)

00:42:47.261 --> 00:42:49.690 line:93%
Make sure water doesn't go into his ears.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.270 line:93%
The bath should last 5 to 10 minutes.

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.000 line:93%
- 5 to 10 minutes. - Yes.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.040 line:93%
Would you like to give it a try?

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.100 line:93%
Yes.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.210 line:93%
Here.

00:43:02.071 --> 00:43:03.910 line:93%
Try holding him.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.580 line:93%
Put your hand on his shoulders.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.080 line:93%
(Careful)

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.221 line:93%
Put your hand on his butt.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.821 line:93%
Begin.

00:43:15.821 --> 00:43:19.491 line:93%
(Bentley is the size of Sam's forearm.)

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.931 line:93%
(Sam washes Bentley with care.)

00:43:25.261 --> 00:43:26.830 line:93%
All right.

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.370 line:93%
(Is he checking the water temperature?)

00:43:29.201 --> 00:43:31.401 line:93%
It's hot.

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:36.310 line:93%
(This water is okay.)

00:43:38.781 --> 00:43:40.511 line:93%
Hey.

00:43:40.511 --> 00:43:44.681 line:93%
(Sam makes sure to keep his touch gentle.)

00:43:45.781 --> 00:43:48.221 line:93%
You are doing great.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.361 line:93%
Let's stop.

00:43:50.821 --> 00:43:54.591 line:93%
With a handkerchief, pat his face dry.

00:43:55.531 --> 00:43:56.631 line:93%
Gently.

00:43:56.631 --> 00:43:57.830 line:93%
Dad.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:00.701 line:93%
All right.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.401 line:93%
(It's time to wash his butt.)

00:44:03.401 --> 00:44:04.571 line:93%
You are doing great.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.301 line:93%
Dad.

00:44:06.301 --> 00:44:07.741 line:93%
(Gently)

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.580 line:93%
You are doing great.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.841 line:93%
Is it too hot?

00:44:12.841 --> 00:44:14.910 line:93%
- My goodness. - Baby.

00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:16.580 line:93%
Baby.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.151 line:93%
I got this.

00:44:21.051 --> 00:44:25.321 line:93%
Disinfect his navel after every bath.

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:27.031 line:93%
Okay.

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.060 line:93%
(After the bath, it's time to feed Bentley.)

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.960 line:93%
(You were hungry, right?)

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.131 line:93%
All right.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:37.971 line:93%
Mom is feeding Ben.

00:44:39.241 --> 00:44:40.410 line:93%
Ben.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:46.080 line:93%
(Let's play when I am a bit bigger.)

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:51.120 line:93%
Thank you.

00:44:51.921 --> 00:44:53.491 line:93%
Thank you.

00:44:54.551 --> 00:44:57.060 line:93%
Bye, Ben. Enjoy your food.

00:44:58.421 --> 00:45:01.491 line:93%
(Dad, see you again.)

00:45:02.361 --> 00:45:05.960 line:93%
(See you again, my brother.)

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.370 line:93%
We will go somewhere fun, William.

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.341 line:93%
I think you will love this place.

00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:13.241 line:93%
(Which place will William love?)

00:45:13.241 --> 00:45:16.071 line:93%
Having Bentley...

00:45:16.071 --> 00:45:19.181 line:93%
took our attention away from William.

00:45:20.051 --> 00:45:22.080 line:93%
Since I feel bad about it,

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.651 line:93%
I wanted to do something for William.

00:45:26.181 --> 00:45:28.390 line:93%
He reads "Star Wars" on his own...

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:30.660 line:93%
and dances to the music.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:32.321 line:93%
This place...

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.730 line:93%
has everything on "Star Wars".

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:39.301 line:93%
He is the biggest fan of "Star Wars".

00:45:39.861 --> 00:45:41.100 line:93%
(Who is the biggest fan of "Star Wars"?)

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.171 line:93%
Who is the biggest fan of "Star Wars"?

00:45:44.171 --> 00:45:45.940 line:93%
(This is his house.)

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:50.080 line:93%
(One man appears with a vacuum cleaner.)

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:53.480 line:93%
(He removes dust in the speed of light.)

00:45:53.511 --> 00:45:55.181 line:93%
This is...

00:45:55.181 --> 00:45:56.781 line:93%
(A tent for cameraman)

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:59.151 line:93%
(Sighing)

00:46:07.031 --> 00:46:10.330 line:93%
He is the cleanest man, Heo Ji Woong.

00:46:13.131 --> 00:46:15.471 line:93%
(He doesn't allow a speck of dust.)

00:46:15.471 --> 00:46:16.841 line:93%
There are snacks.

00:46:16.841 --> 00:46:21.171 line:93%
(He is oversensitive and fussy.)

00:46:25.011 --> 00:46:27.310 line:93%
(They are here.)

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:30.821 line:93%
- My goodness. - Hello.

00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:32.051 line:93%
Hello, hello.

00:46:32.051 --> 00:46:34.250 line:93%
- Hello, hello. - My goodness.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:36.821 line:93%
What's wrong?

00:46:36.821 --> 00:46:38.321 line:93%
(William breaks into tears.)

00:46:38.821 --> 00:46:41.190 line:93%
Why are you crying?

00:46:41.491 --> 00:46:44.431 line:93%
It's okay. What's wrong?

00:46:44.631 --> 00:46:46.730 line:93%
What's wrong?

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:48.600 line:93%
(William isn't familiar with Ji Woong.)

00:46:48.901 --> 00:46:50.171 line:93%
Should I play music?

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:52.671 line:93%
(Running over)

00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:59.841 line:93%
William!

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:01.881 line:93%
Where are you?

00:47:03.151 --> 00:47:04.881 line:93%
(Looking around)

00:47:04.881 --> 00:47:05.980 line:93%
Where are you?

00:47:07.951 --> 00:47:09.321 line:93%
What is this place?

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.060 line:93%
What's in the house that stopped the tears?

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.901 line:93%
From a limited edition spacecraft...

00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:19.100 line:93%
to household items,

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:22.901 line:93%
this house has everything about "Star Wars".

00:47:22.901 --> 00:47:24.241 line:93%
(It's like a miniature museum.)

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.810 line:93%
There is everything.

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:30.681 line:93%
It's Darth Vader.

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:35.910 line:93%
(Singing the theme song of Darth Vader)

00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.381 line:93%
That's Chewbacca. What does it say?

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:42.451 line:93%
(I am Chewbacca.)

00:47:42.451 --> 00:47:45.060 line:93%
Here is Yoda. What does he do?

00:47:45.761 --> 00:47:47.631 line:93%
(He imitates Yoda.)

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:49.261 line:93%
Say hello to Uncle.

00:47:49.261 --> 00:47:51.100 line:93%
- Hello. - Say, "Hello."

00:47:51.361 --> 00:47:52.960 line:93%
- Hello. - Hello.

00:47:53.471 --> 00:47:55.000 line:93%
Why were you so scared?

00:47:55.471 --> 00:47:58.471 line:93%
I don't know.

00:47:58.471 --> 00:48:01.140 line:93%
- He isn't scary. - Am I scary?

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:04.410 line:93%
He does look a bit scary,

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:06.980 line:93%
but he is a nice man.

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:09.781 line:93%
William, other babies can't come to my house.

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.451 line:93%
Is this the first time a baby visited?

00:48:12.451 --> 00:48:14.290 line:93%
- Of course it is. - Really?

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.761 line:93%
Not many adults were invited either.

00:48:16.761 --> 00:48:18.261 line:93%
(Messy people aren't allowed here.)

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:22.431 line:93%
(He is excited about Darth Vader.)

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:25.301 line:93%
I will show you something. Hold on.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.571 line:93%
Uncle will show you something.

00:48:30.241 --> 00:48:31.770 line:93%
William, look forward to it.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.410 line:93%
(In front of William...)

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:42.111 line:93%
(What?)

00:48:44.681 --> 00:48:48.350 line:93%
(Darth Vader of the dark forces)

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:52.190 line:93%
(Is this happening for real?)

00:48:53.761 --> 00:48:54.830 line:93%
Who is that?

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:56.761 line:93%
William.

00:48:56.761 --> 00:49:00.230 line:93%
You don't know the power of the dark side.

00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:03.401 line:93%
(Hello.)

00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:46.131 line:93%
(He approaches Ji Woong. He shows that he's sorry.)

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.270 line:93%
- Okay. - You can't even wipe it.

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:50.901 line:93%
(I'm sorry again.)

00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.201 line:93%
Sam, shouldn't we wash his face?

00:56:53.511 --> 00:56:54.770 line:93%
Yes, we should.

00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:56.270 line:93%
Do you want to come and wash your face?

00:56:57.381 --> 00:56:58.841 line:93%
- All right. - And his clothes too.

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.511 line:93%
He's high-maintenance.

00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:04.221 line:93%
(Farting)

00:57:04.221 --> 00:57:06.480 line:93%
Did you fart? Who just farted?

00:57:06.991 --> 00:57:08.951 line:93%
(He plays innocent.)

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.491 line:93%
All right.

00:57:12.321 --> 00:57:14.131 line:93%
- Mommy! - Mommy?

00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:16.830 line:93%
Yes, yes. Mommy is here.

00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:17.861 line:93%
(Ji Woong washes him while coaxing.)

00:57:17.861 --> 00:57:18.931 line:93%
I got it. Okay.

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.471 line:93%
(This song can fix all of his problems.)

00:57:22.471 --> 00:57:24.270 line:93%
Your hand, please. Let's shake hands.

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:27.611 line:93%
We're done washing now.

00:57:27.971 --> 00:57:28.971 line:93%
Who is that?

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.940 line:93%
- Mommy. - Is that Mommy? Is it?

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:36.480 line:93%
(It's hard not to kiss this ball of cuteness.)

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.350 line:93%
- Mommy. - William.

00:57:38.821 --> 00:57:41.221 line:93%
- Hello. - Hello.

00:57:41.721 --> 00:57:43.921 line:93%
- Daddy. - I'm not your daddy.

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.890 line:93%
- He didn't poop. - You're not Daddy?

00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:47.091 line:93%
No, I'm not.

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:48.790 line:93%
Should we change his diaper?

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.131 line:93%
(Is the neat freak really changing the diaper?)

00:57:51.131 --> 00:57:53.671 line:93%
All right. Let's take this off. Take it off.

00:57:53.671 --> 00:57:55.131 line:93%
You took it off. Yes, you did.

00:57:55.131 --> 00:57:56.171 line:93%
(He finds it intriguing.)

00:57:56.171 --> 00:57:57.241 line:93%
There you go.

00:57:57.241 --> 00:57:58.571 line:93%
(Sam is the assistant.)

00:57:58.571 --> 00:58:01.341 line:93%
Thank you. Gosh, you pooped a lot.

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:06.480 line:93%
(It's his first time changing the diaper.)

00:58:07.551 --> 00:58:09.410 line:93%
- You're all done. - My goodness!

00:58:09.681 --> 00:58:11.120 line:93%
(He successfully changes it.)

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.020 line:93%
- Give me a high-five. - William.

00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:14.750 line:93%
Bump it. Bump it.

00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:17.520 line:93%
(You're the best, Ji Woong!)

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.560 line:93%
High-five!

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:22.560 line:93%
- Meanwhile, Si An... - Hello.

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.100 line:93%
and Dong Gook are at a hospital.

00:58:24.861 --> 00:58:26.201 line:93%
(Where are we?)

00:58:26.201 --> 00:58:28.031 line:93%
Please fill out an application.

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:29.600 line:93%
What's your name?

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.571 line:93%
- Cool Si An. - "Cool Si An"?

00:58:33.241 --> 00:58:34.671 line:93%
How many syllables are in your name?

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:36.410 line:93%
Si An, go over there, and take a seat.

00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:38.841 line:93%
- Let me fill this out. - Okay.

00:58:38.841 --> 00:58:41.580 line:93%
(This kind son does what he's asked.)

00:58:43.721 --> 00:58:46.321 line:93%
Dad, why are we here?

00:58:47.151 --> 00:58:48.421 line:93%
(This place is...)

00:58:48.421 --> 00:58:52.460 line:93%
I don't want you to catch a cold, Si An.

00:58:52.821 --> 00:58:54.690 line:93%
So we're here for a shot to make you stronger.

00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:57.301 line:93%
(So we're here for a shot to make you stronger.)

00:58:57.931 --> 00:59:00.031 line:93%
(A shot?)

00:59:00.531 --> 00:59:03.471 line:93%
(The day of his vaccination shot)

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.540 line:93%
My goodness! It must hurt!

00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:07.011 line:93%
It will pinch a bit.

00:59:07.011 --> 00:59:09.511 line:93%
The shot left him with an intense memory.

00:59:11.511 --> 00:59:13.611 line:93%
- Can he go through this? - Hello.

00:59:13.611 --> 00:59:15.951 line:93%
- Say, "Hello". - Hello.

00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.250 line:93%
He's on his third shot. He's in good shape too.

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:20.491 line:93%
All right. Everything looks good.

00:59:20.491 --> 00:59:23.221 line:93%
Did he have fever after the cold?

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:25.491 line:93%
He had the fever for a couple of days.

00:59:25.821 --> 00:59:27.031 line:93%
Si An, can you do this?

00:59:27.491 --> 00:59:30.301 line:93%
I don't want to get the shot.

00:59:31.861 --> 00:59:33.270 line:93%
You don't want to get the shot?

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.131 line:93%
Why not? It makes you stronger.

00:59:36.571 --> 00:59:38.241 line:93%
It hurts.

00:59:38.971 --> 00:59:41.111 line:93%
No, it doesn't. It hurts just a little.

00:59:41.111 --> 00:59:43.511 line:93%
But once you get it, you get so strong.

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:46.140 line:93%
Just like me. You can be strong like me.

00:59:47.381 --> 00:59:48.551 line:93%
I'm scared.

00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:49.910 line:93%
- Sorry? - This is scary.

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:51.681 line:93%
No, don't be. I'll get it first then.

00:59:51.951 --> 00:59:54.421 line:93%
Get it after you see me get the shot. Okay?

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:57.861 line:93%
Just like a man. Be brave. There you go.

00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:03.131 line:93%
I think you can just roll up your sleeve.

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:06.460 line:93%
Daddy's shot is this big, but yours is small.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.500 line:93%
Mine is bigger.

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:10.640 line:93%
(He feels nervous after looking at it.)

01:00:11.201 --> 01:00:12.341 line:93%
Man up. Be brave.

01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:13.640 line:93%
- I'll do it now. - Watch me.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.011 line:93%
Keep watching me up close.

01:00:15.071 --> 01:00:17.310 line:93%
Let's see how strong he gets.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:18.381 line:93%
It will sting a little.

01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:22.651 line:93%
(So this really doesn't hurt?)

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:28.350 line:93%
Dad, it doesn't hurt?

01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:30.190 line:93%
It doesn't hurt at all.

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:34.460 line:93%
(He's more terrified after watching it up close.)

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:36.761 line:93%
- Can you blow on it? - I don't want to get it.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.600 line:93%
(The plan backfires.)

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000 line:93%
But you get stronger.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.230 line:93%
(Wait. This isn't what I had in mind.)

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:44.640 line:93%
I don't want to get it.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.500 line:93%
With this shot, you can become Spider-Man.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.011 line:93%
You can shoot spider-webs and get super strong.

01:00:49.071 --> 01:00:51.080 line:93%
- I don't want it. - You don't want it?

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:55.310 line:93%
Can I borrow your apple?

01:00:55.381 --> 01:00:56.681 line:93%
Look at me. Look at the apple.

01:00:56.881 --> 01:00:59.250 line:93%
Try to break it into two.

01:00:59.381 --> 01:01:01.190 line:93%
You can't do it, can you? Try it.

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:02.850 line:93%
Try to split it.

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:04.460 line:93%
(With my hands?)

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.190 line:93%
(Struggling)

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:07.230 line:93%
You can't, right?

01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:10.531 line:93%
After getting the shot, I think...

01:01:11.131 --> 01:01:12.600 line:93%
I can do it.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.531 line:93%
(The doctor is surprised.)

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:18.140 line:93%
You get really strong if you get the shot.

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.710 line:93%
Did you see that? Here, eat it.

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:22.210 line:93%
It's a real apple.

01:01:22.741 --> 01:01:23.741 line:93%
(He's showing Si An that it's a real apple.)

01:01:23.741 --> 01:01:25.011 line:93%
Isn't it good? Yes.

01:01:26.281 --> 01:01:27.580 line:93%
I know you can do it.

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:30.881 line:93%
If you don't do it now, you'll get a bigger shot.

01:01:30.881 --> 01:01:32.451 line:93%
- You'll get a bigger one. - Yes.

01:01:32.451 --> 01:01:35.921 line:93%
Do you want 2 shots or 1 shot?

01:01:36.991 --> 01:01:39.460 line:93%
- Say, "Just one, please." - Just one?

01:01:39.591 --> 01:01:40.790 line:93%
Say, "Just one, please."

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.190 line:93%
This will feel cool.

01:01:43.261 --> 01:01:44.830 line:93%
That feels cool.

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:46.600 line:93%
A brave boy wouldn't say it hurts.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.270 line:93%
Si An is a brave boy. He wouldn't cry.

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:50.901 line:93%
Of course not.

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:53.511 line:93%
Okay, Si An.

01:01:53.511 --> 01:01:56.370 line:93%
1, 2, 3.

01:01:58.511 --> 01:02:00.051 line:93%
It's finished, Si An.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.210 line:93%
(He got his shot!)

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:03.210 line:93%
My goodness. Look at that.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.151 line:93%
(It's nothing.)

01:02:06.151 --> 01:02:07.321 line:93%
(Smiling)

01:02:08.051 --> 01:02:10.060 line:93%
You're the best, Si An.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.591 line:93%
It doesn't hurt, right?

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:14.730 line:93%
What a man.

01:02:14.861 --> 01:02:17.131 line:93%
You were so brave.

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:19.431 line:93%
Now, show us your power.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.770 line:93%
Look. Does this hurt?

01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:24.140 line:93%
Does it hurt or not?

01:02:24.201 --> 01:02:26.671 line:93%
You can feel pain, right?

01:02:27.071 --> 01:02:29.241 line:93%
Did it hurt a little? It did, right?

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.640 line:93%
Not at all?

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:33.781 line:93%
Should we try another hospital?

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:35.850 line:93%
Si An.

01:02:36.381 --> 01:02:38.721 line:93%
You were so brave. Do you want a gift?

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.151 line:93%
I don't normally give these out.

01:02:42.221 --> 01:02:44.321 line:93%
I only give it to children who are brave.

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:45.491 line:93%
Thank you.

01:02:45.491 --> 01:02:47.991 line:93%
No problem. You were so brave.

01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:52.901 line:93%
We have to wait here for 10 minutes, okay?

01:02:52.901 --> 01:02:54.031 line:93%
- Okay. - Good.

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:56.000 line:93%
Is it good?

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.040 line:93%
(It tastes so good after a shot.)

01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:00.710 line:93%
(He said I would become Spider-Man, right?)

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.540 line:93%
If you take this, you'll become Spider-Man.

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.910 line:93%
The webs will shoot, and you'll get so strong.

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.810 line:93%
I want to become Spider-Man.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.080 line:93%
Okay, I'll turn you into Spider-Man today.

01:03:11.151 --> 01:03:12.580 line:93%
Since you took the shot and all. Okay?

01:03:13.721 --> 01:03:16.520 line:93%
Si An always...

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.290 line:93%
loved Spider-Man.

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:21.330 line:93%
He would watch carefully and copy him.

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:23.531 line:93%
Spider-Man is so cool.

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.301 line:93%
Si An's dream is about to come true.

01:03:26.301 --> 01:03:29.471 line:93%
(Si An is into Spider-Man these days.)

01:03:29.471 --> 01:03:31.241 line:93%
He can fly too.

01:03:31.801 --> 01:03:34.471 line:93%
Since it's Si An's birthday,

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.540 line:93%
I decided to prepare a surprise.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.350 line:93%
(Transforming)

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:41.850 line:93%
My goodness. It's Spider-Man.

I feel sad that you actually like it.

01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:04.721 line:93%
It hurts me.

01:11:06.021 --> 01:11:07.030 line:93%
What?

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:09.931 line:93%
Si An, the reason why...

01:11:09.931 --> 01:11:12.601 line:93%
I didn't buy you any toys is...

01:11:13.231 --> 01:11:16.000 line:93%
because you have so many toys already.

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:19.540 line:93%
However, there are many friends who have none.

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:22.740 line:93%
I didn't buy you one so we could share with them.

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:26.950 line:93%
Dong Gook wanted to show Si An the joy of sharing.

01:11:27.381 --> 01:11:30.080 line:93%
Could there be a better birthday present?

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.080 line:93%
(He helped Si An make friends in Cambodia.)

01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:34.921 line:93%
Ever since I became a dad to five children,

01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:38.591 line:93%
I started to find interest in children of...

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:41.431 line:93%
the underprivileged.

01:11:41.431 --> 01:11:44.360 line:93%
That's why I wanted to do...

01:11:44.431 --> 01:11:48.530 line:93%
something meaningful for Si An's birthday.

01:11:48.601 --> 01:11:51.801 line:93%
I decided to donate under Si An's name.

01:11:54.641 --> 01:11:56.910 line:93%
Ji Yong and Seung Jae are deep in the woods.

01:11:57.410 --> 01:12:00.051 line:93%
I don't think this is the right place.

01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:01.881 line:93%
We're going this way. This is the way.

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:04.780 line:93%
- The way? - Yes.

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:07.290 line:93%
Way, way, way, way.

01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:11.521 line:93%
There is so much water.

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.160 line:93%
How do we cross it?

01:12:13.221 --> 01:12:14.591 line:93%
How will we cross it?

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.360 line:93%
It's a stream.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.900 line:93%
(They're very deep in the woods.)

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.101 line:93%
It's a stream.

01:12:19.231 --> 01:12:22.231 line:93%
Hold my hand. Here. Good.

01:12:22.231 --> 01:12:23.971 line:93%
(Climbing mountains and crossing waters)

01:12:23.971 --> 01:12:24.971 line:93%
That's it.

01:12:24.971 --> 01:12:27.771 line:93%
(Where are they going?)

01:12:27.971 --> 01:12:29.240 line:93%
I'm a big boy!

01:12:29.641 --> 01:12:30.641 line:93%
Are you a big boy?

01:12:33.011 --> 01:12:35.410 line:93%
Hey, we walked for so long.

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.280 line:93%
Why isn't it coming out?

01:12:38.481 --> 01:12:39.921 line:93%
Did we go the wrong way?

01:12:42.851 --> 01:12:43.860 line:93%
Right?

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.191 line:93%
(There is no reception.)

01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:51.131 line:93%
I can't make calls here. There is no service.

01:12:52.931 --> 01:12:55.370 line:93%
(Nervous)

01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:57.801 line:93%
I'm nervous. There is no one around.

01:12:58.171 --> 01:13:01.040 line:93%
- People? - What if you and I...

01:13:01.171 --> 01:13:02.540 line:93%
get stranded here?

01:13:03.641 --> 01:13:05.910 line:93%
(Thinking)

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:08.110 line:93%
Mister!

01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:09.511 line:93%
Mister!

01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:11.551 line:93%
Mister!

01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:14.620 line:93%
There is a big boy hanging over there.

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:17.820 line:93%
There are people hanging on the trees.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.131 line:93%
Pull it. 1, 2, 3.

01:13:21.261 --> 01:13:22.990 line:93%
What are we looking at?

01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:24.330 line:93%
(Is this where they're going?)

01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:26.101 line:93%
Let's go. What is that?

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:27.900 line:93%
I don't know.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.301 line:93%
Mister, what are you doing?

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:32.900 line:93%
I'm climbing a tree.

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:35.011 line:93%
Are you Tarzan?

01:13:35.271 --> 01:13:37.381 line:93%
I'm Tarzan. I'm Tarzan.

01:13:38.141 --> 01:13:39.881 line:93%
I'm going to be Tarzan too.

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:43.881 line:93%
Where are they visiting?

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:48.691 line:93%
It's a popular leisure sport, tree climbing.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.521 line:93%
Instead of rock climbing, you use a rope...

01:13:51.521 --> 01:13:54.091 line:93%
to climb up to the top of the tree.

01:13:54.591 --> 01:13:57.231 line:93%
Gosh, it looks thrilling.

01:13:57.431 --> 01:13:59.731 line:93%
- He's four. Can he do it? - Of course.

01:14:00.301 --> 01:14:02.870 line:93%
- Can he do it? - We start from four.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.240 line:93%
- Starting from four. - Yes.

01:14:04.441 --> 01:14:06.441 line:93%
Do you see the girl at the top?

01:14:07.441 --> 01:14:09.070 line:93%
- Can you do it like her? - Yes.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.681 line:93%
I can do that.

01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:15.811 line:93%
I can go to the very top.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.120 line:93%
Can you?

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:18.580 line:93%
- Shall we try? - Yes!

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:20.051 line:93%
Okay, let's go.

01:14:20.551 --> 01:14:22.851 line:93%
Seung Jae will give it a try.

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:24.860 line:93%
Here.

01:14:25.091 --> 01:14:26.731 line:93%
Safety first!

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.360 line:93%
- Safety. You're educated. - Safety!

01:14:31.431 --> 01:14:33.431 line:93%
(From head to toe,)

01:14:33.431 --> 01:14:35.070 line:93%
(he cares about safety.)

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:36.101 line:93%
Safety first!

01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:39.700 line:93%
(I'll be in charge of everyone's safety.)

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:40.870 line:93%
Do you want to try zip lining?

01:14:41.341 --> 01:14:43.171 line:93%
(Startled)

01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:47.410 line:93%
Last summer, zip lining made him...

01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:49.351 line:93%
become timid for the first time.

01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:52.080 line:93%
Will he be all right this time?

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.750 line:93%
(It was a silent but thrilling experience.)

01:14:56.921 --> 01:14:58.360 line:93%
We'll go up here.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.521 line:93%
(Will Seung Jae be able to ride it?)

01:14:59.891 --> 01:15:02.691 line:93%
Dad will have to ride it too.

01:15:02.691 --> 01:15:05.030 line:93%
Seung Jae, you'll ride it alone this time.

01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:06.870 line:93%
We rode together last time.

01:15:07.631 --> 01:15:10.240 line:93%
This time, he has to ride without his dad.

01:15:10.301 --> 01:15:12.070 line:93%
What is he going to do?

01:15:12.971 --> 01:15:14.610 line:93%
- Dad! - Yes?

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:17.910 line:93%
Dad, don't worry!

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.080 line:93%
Let's go, Seung Jae.

01:15:22.011 --> 01:15:24.620 line:93%
- Let's go! - 3, 2, 1.

01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:28.691 line:93%
(Screaming)

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.990 line:93%
(He likes it?)

01:15:32.691 --> 01:15:36.490 line:93%
(He's zip lining alone for the first time.)

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.731 line:93%
(This is so exciting.)

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:43.570 line:93%
It's faster than I thought.

01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:49.210 line:93%
(It's so thrilling.)

01:15:50.181 --> 01:15:52.441 line:93%
Seung Jae, did you have fun?

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.080 line:93%
- Well? - Yes.

01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:56.181 line:93%
Great job, Seung Jae.

01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:57.580 line:93%
You were so cool.

01:15:58.921 --> 01:16:01.421 line:93%
- Here you go. - Safety first.

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:03.860 line:93%
What is this?

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.691 line:93%
(He found something.)

01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:09.530 line:93%
Mister! Good luck!

01:16:09.931 --> 01:16:11.131 line:93%
Good luck!

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.570 line:93%
He found someone climbing a tree.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.910 line:93%
You must climb up 50m.

01:16:21.971 --> 01:16:23.641 line:93%
It's called, "monkey climbing".

01:16:23.641 --> 01:16:24.881 line:93%
(Monkey climbing takes you up 50m.)

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.851 line:93%
What are you doing?

01:16:27.511 --> 01:16:30.650 line:93%
Good luck. Good luck.

01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:31.681 line:93%
(This looks fun too.)

01:16:33.591 --> 01:16:35.521 line:93%
I want to try too.

01:16:37.421 --> 01:16:39.460 line:93%
I want to try it too!

01:16:39.721 --> 01:16:41.731 line:93%
I'm going to go all the way up.

01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:44.301 line:93%
- Me too. - You can't do it.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.070 line:93%
I can put my fingers in.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:50.271 line:93%
Grab it.

01:16:53.441 --> 01:16:55.040 line:93%
Dad, push me.

01:16:57.341 --> 01:16:58.341 line:93%
Grab it.

01:17:00.551 --> 01:17:03.981 line:93%
Dad. Dad...

01:17:03.981 --> 01:17:05.080 line:93%
I can't do it.

01:17:05.681 --> 01:17:07.721 line:93%
I said, I can't do it.

01:17:08.551 --> 01:17:10.021 line:93%
(Help me, teacher.)

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.160 line:93%
Here we go.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:13.330 line:93%
Here we go.

01:17:13.591 --> 01:17:16.131 line:93%
One of the experts helped him go up...

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.900 line:93%
towards the sky.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.500 line:93%
Here we go.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:21.731 line:93%
Here we go.

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:27.511 line:93%
(Seung Jae is getting close to the sky.)

01:17:28.771 --> 01:17:29.841 line:93%
How is it, Seung Jae?

01:17:29.841 --> 01:17:31.811 line:93%
- It's fun! - Is it fun?

01:17:32.011 --> 01:17:33.650 line:93%
You're up so high.

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:35.851 line:93%
I became Tarzan.

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:37.950 line:93%
- Aren't you scared? - No.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.250 line:93%
Hello!

01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:43.360 line:93%
(He's a polite kid even up in the sky.)

01:17:43.421 --> 01:17:45.620 line:93%
My goodness.

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:46.860 line:93%
(He's so excited.)

01:17:48.091 --> 01:17:49.360 line:93%
Up to the very top...

01:17:52.131 --> 01:17:53.731 line:93%
(Seung Jae the Tarzan is roaring.)

01:17:53.731 --> 01:17:56.000 line:93%
- It's so much fun. - He's not scared.

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:57.941 line:93%
That's amazing.

01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:01.771 line:93%
(He's suddenly blanking out.)

01:18:03.841 --> 01:18:11.080 line:93%
(Was the sky always so beautiful?)

01:18:12.381 --> 01:18:15.490 line:93%
(He can appreciate natural beauty.)

01:18:17.221 --> 01:18:19.561 line:93%
- Will you live there? - No!

01:18:20.231 --> 01:18:22.330 line:93%
We'll get you down if you say you love me.

01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:24.960 line:93%
No, I want to go up more!

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.931 line:93%
No, I want to go up more!

01:18:26.931 --> 01:18:28.631 line:93%
(Speechless)

01:18:30.101 --> 01:18:33.141 line:93%
(Seung Jae is ahead of his dad.)

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:35.610 line:93%
Promise to be a good boy and we'll bring you down.

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:38.311 line:93%
- I want to go up more! - No.

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:39.780 line:93%
Are you going to live there?

01:18:41.410 --> 01:18:42.580 line:93%
I'm going to play more.

01:18:43.481 --> 01:18:45.580 line:93%
- Do you like hanging? - Yes.

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:47.721 line:93%
What do you feel like?

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:49.820 line:93%
- Me? Tarzan. - What do you feel like?

01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:51.860 line:93%
- Tarzan. - Do you feel like Tarzan?

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.360 line:93%
Please bring me down a little bit!

01:18:55.591 --> 01:18:59.061 line:93%
Not a lot. Just a little.

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.400 line:93%
Say, "I'll listen to my dad."

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:05.200 line:93%
I'll listen to my dad.

01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:08.311 line:93%
I'll listen to my dad.

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.740 line:93%
Please bring him down.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.551 line:93%
No, go back up.

01:19:14.551 --> 01:19:15.750 line:93%
(He wants to play more.)

01:19:16.721 --> 01:19:18.450 line:93%
- Is it fun? - No,

01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:20.191 line:93%
let me go back up.

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:24.921 line:93%
(He's staring into the sky.)

01:19:24.921 --> 01:19:25.921 line:93%
What are you looking at?

01:19:25.921 --> 01:19:27.660 line:93%
(He's staring into the sky.)

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:29.731 line:93%
- He's looking at the sky. - Are you?

01:19:30.261 --> 01:19:32.301 line:93%
Is it beautiful? Is it pretty?

01:19:33.471 --> 01:19:34.500 line:93%
Yes.

01:19:35.231 --> 01:19:36.740 line:93%
Do you know what this is?

01:19:37.771 --> 01:19:39.500 line:93%
What is it? A bird?

01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:41.641 line:93%
It's a seesaw. Seesaw.

01:19:43.511 --> 01:19:45.580 line:93%
You drew a seesaw.

01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:47.181 line:93%
Lo Hee.

01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:49.851 line:93%
You should brush your teeth.

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:50.851 line:93%
When should we do it?

01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:52.450 line:93%
(Ignoring)

01:19:52.450 --> 01:19:54.790 line:93%
Lo Hee, when should we brush your teeth?

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:56.051 line:93%
She's acting like she can't hear me.

01:19:57.290 --> 01:20:00.830 line:93%
You're usually good at it. Why don't you want to?

01:20:01.391 --> 01:20:03.700 line:93%
(Singing)

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.731 line:93%
Lo Hee.

01:20:05.530 --> 01:20:06.561 line:93%
She's ignoring us.

01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:11.141 line:93%
We'll brush your teeth after the blocks, okay?

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.000 line:93%
Why did this go here?

01:20:14.370 --> 01:20:16.981 line:93%
You finished playing, so we should go brush.

01:20:18.011 --> 01:20:20.051 line:93%
Lo Hee, won't you brush your teeth?

01:20:21.210 --> 01:20:22.681 line:93%
(Flopping)

01:20:23.210 --> 01:20:25.120 line:93%
I don't want to.

01:20:25.851 --> 01:20:26.921 line:93%
Lo Hee.

01:20:26.921 --> 01:20:29.450 line:93%
- If you don't... - No, no!

01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:31.521 line:93%
No, no!

01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:38.330 line:93%
How will Tae Young solve this problem?

01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:41.631 line:93%
(He's suddenly going somewhere.)

01:20:48.271 --> 01:20:51.841 line:93%
(Who's calling?)

01:20:51.981 --> 01:20:52.981 line:93%
Hello?

01:20:53.981 --> 01:20:55.011 line:93%
Lo Hee!

01:20:55.811 --> 01:20:57.521 line:93%
My name is Kong Soon.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.521 line:93%
Kong Soon! Kong Soon's scarf.

01:21:00.691 --> 01:21:02.351 line:93%
- Awesome, awesome! - Awesome, awesome!

01:21:02.421 --> 01:21:05.160 line:93%
Lo Hee's favorite friend Kong Soon called her.

01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:06.960 line:93%
What's going on?

01:21:07.731 --> 01:21:10.231 line:93%
Lo Hee, can you see me?

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:14.131 line:93%
I think Lo Hee is at the age...

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.671 line:93%
where she won't listen.

01:21:16.801 --> 01:21:19.301 line:93%
She does the opposite of what we tell her.

01:21:20.311 --> 01:21:21.811 line:93%
She used to be good at brushing her teeth.

01:21:21.811 --> 01:21:24.641 line:93%
These days, she refuses to brush.

01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:27.910 line:93%
If her friend Kong Soon calls her...

01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:31.320 line:93%
to tell her to brush her teeth,

01:21:32.021 --> 01:21:34.790 line:93%
I thought she might listen.

01:21:36.551 --> 01:21:37.561 line:93%
Lo Hee.

01:21:37.921 --> 01:21:39.221 line:93%
(Kong Soon's phone call operation!)

01:21:39.221 --> 01:21:40.691 line:93%
Didn't you miss me?

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.191 line:93%
(Staring)

01:21:43.191 --> 01:21:45.231 line:93%
Kong Soon, why are you standing?

01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:47.870 line:93%
(Startled)

01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:50.200 line:93%
- Well... - Why are you standing?

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.811 line:93%
I'm standing so I can call you.

01:21:55.641 --> 01:21:59.780 line:93%
My dad will come soon. Hold on.

01:21:59.981 --> 01:22:02.410 line:93%
I think your dad went somewhere.

01:22:02.410 --> 01:22:04.681 line:93%
- He'll be back soon. - Dad!

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:08.421 line:93%
Dad... Dad...

01:22:08.421 --> 01:22:09.990 line:93%
(Dad, Kong Soon called me.)

01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:11.120 line:93%
Dad.

01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:15.091 line:93%
(Eugene is taking over instead.)

01:22:15.091 --> 01:22:16.860 line:93%
Who is this?

01:22:17.131 --> 01:22:18.231 line:93%
- Kong Soon. - What?

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:19.700 line:93%
Lo Hee.

01:22:20.601 --> 01:22:22.700 line:93%
Who is the person beside you?

01:22:24.141 --> 01:22:26.101 line:93%
- Ki Tae Young. - Ki Tae Young...

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.641 line:93%
Who is Ki Tae Young?

01:22:29.341 --> 01:22:31.141 line:93%
- Dad. - Dad?

01:22:31.141 --> 01:22:33.210 line:93%
I see. He's your dad.

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:34.780 line:93%
Lo Hee.

01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:37.820 line:93%
Did you brush your teeth this morning?

01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.051 line:93%
No.

01:22:40.521 --> 01:22:42.891 line:93%
Does it hurt when you brush it?

01:22:43.721 --> 01:22:44.721 line:93%
(Nodding)

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.391 line:93%
Really?

01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:50.301 line:93%
If Mom and Dad brush you gently,

01:22:50.301 --> 01:22:52.261 line:93%
will you brush your teeth?

01:22:52.731 --> 01:22:53.900 line:93%
(Nodding)

01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:57.641 line:93%
Then, I will tell your dad for you.

01:22:57.841 --> 01:22:59.740 line:93%
- Yes? Yes? - Lo Hee's dad.

01:23:00.271 --> 01:23:03.070 line:93%
Please be gentle when you brush her.

01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:04.740 line:93%
Okay, Kong Soon.

01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:06.681 line:93%
Shall we go brush your teeth?

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:08.450 line:93%
(Let's go brush our teeth!)

01:23:08.811 --> 01:23:10.120 line:93%
(Rising)

01:23:10.881 --> 01:23:13.120 line:93%
- Brush... - Wow, are you going?

01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:15.891 line:93%
You listen to Kong Soon.

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.691 line:93%
We'll be back after we brush it.

01:23:18.891 --> 01:23:21.530 line:93%
You're so good at brushing teeth.

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:24.400 line:93%
Yes. She's brushing her teeth.

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:28.101 line:93%
My gosh, you can do it all by yourself.

01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:33.311 line:93%
Lo Hee, show us how good you are.

01:23:33.971 --> 01:23:34.971 line:93%
Okay.

01:23:35.141 --> 01:23:37.610 line:93%
You're good at rinsing too.

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.610 line:93%
Good.

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:42.181 line:93%
Lo Hee was always good at washing her face.

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:46.450 line:93%
My goodness. You're really good.

01:23:48.521 --> 01:23:51.490 line:93%
I'm going to follow Kong Soon.

01:23:51.691 --> 01:23:52.691 line:93%
Are you following her?

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.631 line:93%
(Lo Hee's excitement level is through the roof.)

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:58.931 line:93%
You have to go like this here.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.700 line:93%
- Like this. - Keep going.

01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:02.971 line:93%
Cute girl.

01:24:03.101 --> 01:24:04.870 line:93%
That's amazing.

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.271 line:93%
(There is a baby chair in the interview room.)

01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:12.110 line:93%
(What she didn't get to say to Kong Soon)

01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:13.481 line:93%
Lo Hee, hit the slate.

01:24:13.481 --> 01:24:15.311 line:93%
Clap once. 1, 2, 3.

01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:17.381 line:93%
(She's starting by hitting the slate.)

01:24:18.150 --> 01:24:22.150 line:93%
Kong Soon! Please call me!

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.620 line:93%
I'm waiting for you!

01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:27.931 line:93%
Come to my house. Come and play.

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.330 line:93%
I'll give you something delicious.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.061 line:93%
I'll give you watermelon too.

01:24:33.431 --> 01:24:35.200 line:93%
I'll go buy a watermelon.

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:37.341 line:93%
She got to her feet right away.

01:24:37.471 --> 01:24:39.301 line:93%
More than what me or my husband say,

01:24:39.301 --> 01:24:42.410 line:93%
Kong Soon has a huge influence on her.

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:45.011 line:93%
I used to be very harsh on her.

01:24:45.141 --> 01:24:48.381 line:93%
I think it was the wrong way for Lo Hee.

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:51.120 line:93%
From now, I'll try a positive method...

01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:54.391 line:93%
to teach her.

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:57.360 line:93%
(Tae Young and Lo Hee are going out.)

01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:00.731 line:93%
Lo Hee, we're giving the car a bath.

01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:05.160 line:93%
Where did they arrive?

01:25:07.601 --> 01:25:09.301 line:93%
(I'll take care of my own car.)

01:25:09.301 --> 01:25:11.271 line:93%
It's a self-car wash center...

01:25:11.271 --> 01:25:12.271 line:93%
full of people who like to wash their own cars.

01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:16.240 line:93%
Lo Hee, let's give the car a good wash.

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:20.610 line:93%
(I better take out all my equipment.)

01:25:21.051 --> 01:25:22.710 line:93%
(He has a lot of stuff.)

01:25:22.710 --> 01:25:24.820 line:93%
You must wash your car a lot.

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.620 line:93%
He looks like an expert.

01:25:29.091 --> 01:25:32.021 line:93%
He has professional equipment. He's ready.

01:25:32.021 --> 01:25:33.631 line:93%
(They're ready to wash the car.)

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:37.030 line:93%
Okay. Will you help me?

01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:38.301 line:93%
- Yes. - Okay.

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:40.370 line:93%
Today,

01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:44.141 line:93%
I'll get rid of my stress by washing the car.

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:46.101 line:93%
It fits me perfectly.

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.540 line:93%
- Is it in? - Yes, it's ready.

01:25:48.971 --> 01:25:50.841 line:93%
1, 2, 3, let's go!

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:54.250 line:93%
I decided to live a BOLO life.

01:25:54.851 --> 01:25:55.950 line:93%
Do you mean YOLO?

01:25:56.381 --> 01:25:58.181 line:93%
No, BOLO. Not YOLO.

01:25:58.481 --> 01:26:01.221 line:93%
BOLO life means you raise your child...

01:26:01.391 --> 01:26:04.160 line:93%
while sharing your own hobby...

01:26:04.261 --> 01:26:06.391 line:93%
with your kid.

01:26:06.391 --> 01:26:08.360 line:93%
Before having Lo Hee,

01:26:08.490 --> 01:26:10.101 line:93%
I enjoyed washing the car.

01:26:10.101 --> 01:26:12.301 line:93%
It helped me get rid of my stress.

01:26:12.601 --> 01:26:15.931 line:93%
Today, I will have a nice time with Lo Hee.

01:26:16.431 --> 01:26:18.370 line:93%
(They're starting to wash the car.)

01:26:18.370 --> 01:26:20.671 line:93%
(Step 1: Rinsing)

01:26:21.570 --> 01:26:23.381 line:93%
It gets rid of my stress.

01:26:23.381 --> 01:26:24.881 line:93%
(It's washing away his stress.)

01:26:24.881 --> 01:26:28.811 line:93%
(Step 2: Foam wash)

01:26:31.351 --> 01:26:33.921 line:93%
(Wait...)

01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:37.120 line:93%
(The foam is flurrying like snow.)

01:26:40.561 --> 01:26:42.960 line:93%
(That looks cool.)

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:46.061 line:93%
(Everything turned white.)

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.330 line:93%
Dad, put some foam on my bus.

01:26:49.471 --> 01:26:51.040 line:93%
- Do you want foam? - Yes.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.210 line:93%
(Lo Hee's bus is getting a wash too.)

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:56.240 line:93%
Rinse it yourself.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:58.610 line:93%
Okay, I'll try.

01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:01.381 line:93%
(Swirling)

01:27:03.681 --> 01:27:06.921 line:93%
(They're each taking care of their cars.)

01:27:07.691 --> 01:27:10.290 line:93%
Okay, let's clean.

01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:11.691 line:93%
Here.

01:27:11.691 --> 01:27:14.391 line:93%
They're perfect car washing partners.

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.731 line:93%
We're making the car squeaky clean.

01:27:18.330 --> 01:27:20.601 line:93%
Let's clean your mouth.

01:27:20.771 --> 01:27:22.530 line:93%
Brush, brush.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.570 line:93%
(Joking)

01:27:24.570 --> 01:27:26.040 line:93%
Brush, brush.

01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:29.141 line:93%
(Right!)

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.681 line:93%
Dad, hold this.

01:27:32.110 --> 01:27:33.681 line:93%
Where is Moi?

01:27:35.481 --> 01:27:37.820 line:93%
(Are you in there?)

01:27:39.551 --> 01:27:41.551 line:93%
Where is Moi?

01:27:42.021 --> 01:27:43.790 line:93%
Where is Moi?

01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:45.790 line:93%
Moi is in the car.

01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:48.790 line:93%
I'll take her out after we're done.

01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:51.860 line:93%
- Take her out now. - We can't right now.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.931 line:93%
Let's work together.

01:27:55.231 --> 01:27:57.271 line:93%
Lo Hee is heading for the door alone.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.271 line:93%
No way...

01:28:01.811 --> 01:28:03.811 line:93%
What do we do?

01:28:03.811 --> 01:28:05.481 line:93%
(It's open.)

01:28:07.710 --> 01:28:08.881 line:93%
This is it.

01:28:08.881 --> 01:28:11.051 line:93%
(She rescued Moi.)

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.851 line:93%
(He hasn't seen Moi yet.)

01:28:13.351 --> 01:28:15.620 line:93%
Why won't the door close?

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:18.460 line:93%
(The door is open.)

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.061 line:93%
(He's starting to rinse the car.)

01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:28.330 line:93%
What do we do?

01:28:28.771 --> 01:28:30.641 line:93%
Maybe he can't see the door from there.

01:28:31.801 --> 01:28:32.801 line:93%
My goodness...

01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:36.210 line:93%
(Working hard)

01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:41.881 line:93%
Hey!

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:45.721 line:93%
(He can't believe what happened.)

01:28:45.721 --> 01:28:47.120 line:93%
(Rushing)

01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:49.691 line:93%
(Rushing)

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:52.221 line:93%
Lo Hee. Why did you open this?

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.990 line:93%
(What's going on?)

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.561 line:93%
- Did you open it? - Yes.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.131 line:93%
What am I going to do?

01:29:04.101 --> 01:29:05.641 line:93%
Why did you open it?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.141 line:93%
To rescue Moi.

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:10.311 line:93%
You were trying to rescue Moi?

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:11.610 line:93%
(Speechless)

01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:13.910 line:93%
You shouldn't open it when I'm washing the car.

01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:15.851 line:93%
You should have asked me.

01:29:15.981 --> 01:29:18.280 line:93%
Right, you did ask me.

01:29:18.381 --> 01:29:20.351 line:93%
(Sighing)

01:29:20.490 --> 01:29:22.391 line:93%
Lo Hee, I'll finish up quickly.

01:29:24.191 --> 01:29:25.620 line:93%
Moi, do you want a bath?

01:29:28.061 --> 01:29:30.261 line:93%
You got wet.

01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:33.131 line:93%
(Splashing)

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:38.000 line:93%
(Lo Hee's pants are getting wet.)

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.471 line:93%
I'll wash Moi with this.

01:29:42.441 --> 01:29:44.410 line:93%
(She's putting soap on Moi.)

01:29:45.681 --> 01:29:49.210 line:93%
Now, I'll take Moi out.

01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:50.250 line:93%
(I'll take you out now.)

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.221 line:93%
What is this?

01:29:53.181 --> 01:29:55.551 line:93%
My goodness. You're all wet.

01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:57.990 line:93%
(Drenched)

01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:59.721 line:93%
What is this? What happened?

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.061 line:93%
- Did you bathe her? - Yes.

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.801 line:93%
(It's hard to live a BOLO life.)

01:30:05.801 --> 01:30:07.870 line:93%
Don't tell me you used that soap.

01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:10.171 line:93%
Did you use the pink one?

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.271 line:93%
No.

01:30:14.641 --> 01:30:17.040 line:93%
No? Are you sure?

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.040 line:93%
Yes...

01:30:18.481 --> 01:30:19.881 line:93%
Your nose will grow.

01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:22.351 line:93%
- Did you use it? - Yes.

01:30:22.351 --> 01:30:23.851 line:93%
(She's coming clean.)
