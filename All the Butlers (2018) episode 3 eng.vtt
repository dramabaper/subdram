00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.540 line:93%
(The master says,)

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.011 line:93%
(there's wisdom in the rhythm.)

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:12.280 line:93%
(Great confusion)

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.280 line:93%
(Listen to your own beat.)

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.480 line:93%
(Wake up your cells of madness.)

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.191 line:93%
(Those who have gone crazy about the rhythm will find enlightenment.)

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:24.191 line:93%
(Stop)

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.461 line:93%
(And...)

00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:32.261 line:93%
(one heavy blow...)

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:34.870 line:93%
(that made everyone cry)

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.740 line:93%
(The last episode with an eccentric master)

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.370 line:93%
(It begins now.)

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.751 line:93%
(They sleep early as the master does.)

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.919 line:93%
I'm hungry.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.390 line:93%
Gosh, I want to go to a cart bar.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.129 line:93%
I can't sleep when I feel hungry.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.899 line:93%
I'm starving.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.830 line:93%
If you sleep with an empty stomach,

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:09.670 line:93%
you wouldn't grow.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.209 line:93%
(Are you sleeping?)

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:15.239 line:93%
(I'm hungry. My stomach keeps growling.)

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:17.610 line:93%
"My stomach keeps growling."

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:18.840 line:93%
What?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.709 line:93%
Seung Gi said he's starving.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.450 line:93%
Do you want to eat something? Do you want some food, Sang Yun?

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.090 line:93%
I have to eat to sleep.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.989 line:93%
- Let's go to the kitchen. - For real?

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.629 line:93%
(For now...)

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:38.759 line:93%
(Let's gather.)

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.769 line:93%
Let's eat. I can't do this.

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:42.670 line:93%
To our room.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.069 line:93%
To our room.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:46.140 line:93%
(To our room)

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.569 line:93%
Did Seung Gi say he can come out?

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.070 line:93%
He said the master is sleeping very well.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.770 line:93%
(Okay. Let's go.)

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.639 line:93%
We need to eat or we'll be in trouble.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.910 line:93%
- Well... - This is so...

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:00.210 line:93%
(Squealing)

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.289 line:93%
(Closing the door carefully not to wake the master up)

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.930 line:93%
Wow, I'm so hungry.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.370 line:93%
(I'm out of breath because of hunger.)

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.170 line:93%
Wait a minute, then...

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.939 line:93%
- This one... - Shall we fold it like this?

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.240 line:93%
Is it hard to place it there since there's a pillow?

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.339 line:93%
- Good. - This is great.

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:29.409 line:93%
This is good.

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.550 line:93%
- This is enough. - Great.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.650 line:93%
I feel happy to sit down here and...

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.080 line:93%
- It's warm. - This is it.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.719 line:93%
We need something to eat.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.020 line:93%
I heard Seung Gi brought something for field training.

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.089 line:93%
(I'm bringing it now.)

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.400 line:93%
- Are you here? - Yes.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.430 line:93%
Are you here?

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.670 line:93%
(So glad)

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.270 line:93%
- Welcome. - Did you bring it?

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.839 line:93%
I thought my stomach was going to be ripped.

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.610 line:93%
- It made a sound continuously. - I know.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.740 line:93%
- Seriously. - I'm serious.

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.009 line:93%
The sound had to stop after it was made once or twice.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.249 line:93%
- Is this something to eat? - No.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.120 line:93%
(A heavy bag that Seung Gi brought)

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.650 line:93%
(Emperor Seung Gi's return to a variety show)

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.920 line:93%
(I brought luggage.)

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.159 line:93%
(It was obviously a burden.)

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.999 line:93%
(But he treasured it so much.)

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.170 line:93%
(The luggage he used to carry around as if it was a part of his body)

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.740 line:93%
(It's going to be opened now.)

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.370 line:93%
I feel so happy.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.509 line:93%
(What is inside anyway?)

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.210 line:93%
(What Seung Gi brought was...)

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.080 line:93%
(cookware for field mess!)

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:46.890 line:93%
(For our daily meal...)

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.259 line:93%
This is awesome.

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:51.189 line:93%
(A pot)

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.129 line:93%
(A safety pallet)

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.330 line:93%
I had three.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.400 line:93%
(And even portable gas stoves!)

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.599 line:93%
You have everything.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.839 line:93%
- I don't know what to say. - I'm happy.

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:01.870 line:93%
This is it.

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:04.839 line:93%
Let's have us refreshed first.

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.309 line:93%
(Let's have us refreshed.)

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:07.379 line:93%
(This is incredible.)

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.879 line:93%
- You're so awesome. - I know.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.550 line:93%
(Seung Gi's experience in variety shows pay off.)

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.209 line:93%
- Is it a pallet? - Yes, it is.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.949 line:93%
Did you use to have these?

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.490 line:93%
Yes, these are the things I used to carry around in field.

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:20.559 line:93%
I used to carry them around,

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.059 line:93%
but I learned how to use these during the military service.

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:26.889 line:93%
- What shall we eat first? - What did he bring?

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.699 line:93%
I have tteokbokki, dumplings,

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:30.360 line:93%
and ramen.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.870 line:93%
What is it? What is this?

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.139 line:93%
I also have hoppang.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.809 line:93%
And ramen...

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.379 line:93%
- First, tteokbokki and dumplings... - What shall we eat first?

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.850 line:93%
Let's start with tteokbokki and dumplings first.

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:45.309 line:93%
Something like that...

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.749 line:93%
(Tteokbokki and dumplings...)

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.189 line:93%
(All they had today was rice crust.)

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.220 line:93%
(Because of the master who favors the rice crust most,)

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.590 line:93%
(we had to eat...)

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.829 line:93%
(more than enough rice crust.)

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:02.459 line:93%
- This is awesome. - I know.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.970 line:93%
- Is this a pallet? - Yes, it is.

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.100 line:93%
Wow, dumplings...

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.809 line:93%
(Seung Gi's late night restaurant)

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:15.540 line:93%
If we put some instant rice in here, we can also have fried rice.

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:17.280 line:93%
(First, he starts to make tteokbokki.)

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.980 line:93%
I think you can put more sauce.

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.449 line:93%
- Can I put in all the fishcakes? - Yes. Just put all of them in.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.490 line:93%
(Seong Jae, the youngest, squeezes the sauce until the very last drop.)

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.490 line:93%
(And he puts it into his mouth.)

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.430 line:93%
(How long has it been since I had MSG?)

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.430 line:93%
Is it good?

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.499 line:93%
Is it that good? I told you.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.800 line:93%
(Our Seong Jae is so cute.)

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.740 line:93%
That's right. We need to eat some food.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.439 line:93%
- This... - Amazing.

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.680 line:93%
(Seung Gi's tteokbokki is starting to be cooked.)

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.410 line:93%
It looks so good.

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:54.280 line:93%
(The smell, warmth,)

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.749 line:93%
(and humidity...)

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:57.990 line:93%
I didn't know it'd be such a happy moment.

00:05:58.389 --> 00:05:59.850 line:93%
(Laughing)

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.590 line:93%
This is really irresistible. You can't deny it.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.590 line:93%
Isn't it great?

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.399 line:93%
You should admit it from right, left, forward, backward, everywhere.

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:10.030 line:93%
(He doesn't understand a word, but he feels so happy.)

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.639 line:93%
This is crazy.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.840 line:93%
- Can you stir it once? - Look at the cheese.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.340 line:93%
Try it.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.709 line:93%
- Can we start? - Yes.

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:26.009 line:93%
Don't you have to taste it first?

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.879 line:93%
I didn't taste it, but it looks good enough.

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:29.850 line:93%
I didn't taste it.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.290 line:93%
- Dumplings... - Goodness. This looks good.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.559 line:93%
This is amazing.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.959 line:93%
Dumplings...

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.459 line:93%
(A proper meal for the first time after a day)

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.399 line:93%
(Goodness)

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:52.269 line:93%
(There are only single cries...)

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:55.209 line:93%
(in Seung Gi's late night restaurant.)

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:57.350 line:93%
It has been a long time since I felt this good.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.480 line:93%
It's very chewy.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.980 line:93%
- This is great. - It's delicious.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.350 line:93%
The food was made quickly.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.749 line:93%
- I think it's great. - The ramen seasoning made it tasty.

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:08.759 line:93%
(Both the owner and the customers feel very satisfied.)

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:16.259 line:93%
(Is it delicious?)

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.480 line:93%
(It's very delicious, but...)

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.910 line:93%
(somehow they feel uncomfortable.)

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:41.019 line:93%
(Is it really okay for us to be eating like this?)

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.730 line:93%
To speak frankly,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.129 line:93%
I learned a lot of things spiritually.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.670 line:93%
Can we just sustain our eating habit?

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:57.540 line:93%
Isn't it okay?

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:04.050 line:93%
Although our master liked the rice crust a lot...

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.209 line:93%
It'd be good if we put some rice cake in it.

00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:06.680 line:93%
- It's just... - That sounds good.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.649 line:93%
we didn't really use to live a life like this before.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.519 line:93%
That's why we were hungry. I think the master will understand.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.120 line:93%
See, we didn't eat other nutrients but carbon.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.930 line:93%
- We didn't have any protein. - I agree.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.499 line:93%
Though we need carbohydrate for using our brain,

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:21.899 line:93%
our body might have felt something.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:23.199 line:93%
It might have felt that this isn't good.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:25.269 line:93%
It's better to eat tteokbokki with an upset stomach.

00:08:26.999 --> 00:08:28.040 line:93%
Good.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.240 line:93%
(Starting to focus on eating)

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.970 line:93%
How can we hold ourselves back from eating something tasty?

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:38.610 line:93%
(Eating tteokbokki hastily without feeling any guilt)

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.779 line:93%
Let's just eat.

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:44.789 line:93%
(Four hungry men cleared a pot of tteokbokki already.)

00:08:44.789 --> 00:08:45.919 line:93%
This is so delicious.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.990 line:93%
I didn't have enough yet.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.860 line:93%
Do you still need to have more?

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.060 line:93%
- Eat these. - Let's have ramyeon for dessert.

00:08:54.429 --> 00:08:56.029 line:93%
The base of the soup is the tteokbokki sauce.

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:57.399 line:93%
(The dessert of Seung Gi's late night restaurant is ramen.)

00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:59.669 line:93%
- It's like anchovy meat broth. - That's right.

00:08:59.669 --> 00:09:01.169 line:93%
(1. Tteokbokki sauce soup 2. Ramyeon noodles)

00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:02.539 line:93%
This will taste amazing.

00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:04.710 line:93%
And put quail eggs too.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.110 line:93%
Where are quail eggs?

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.480 line:93%
Put all of them. We still have one more pack.

00:09:10.909 --> 00:09:12.080 line:93%
That's good.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.649 line:93%
- You're so good. - He is.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.519 line:93%
Me? I used to do field mess.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:18.620 line:93%
Everything should be fast and easy.

00:09:18.749 --> 00:09:20.560 line:93%
- But it's tasty. - Right?

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.960 line:93%
I just want to watch it.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.060 line:93%
I know.

00:09:25.659 --> 00:09:27.529 line:93%
Everyone, let's eat.

00:09:27.529 --> 00:09:28.560 line:93%
- Can we eat? - Yes.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.870 line:93%
Try it. I didn't taste it, but it'll be good.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.669 line:93%
I didn't taste it.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.370 line:93%
I think it's tasty enough.

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:36.700 line:93%
I'll just try it.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.169 line:93%
(Ramyeon, you're saved in my stomach too.)

00:09:39.169 --> 00:09:40.370 line:93%
It's good.

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:51.950 line:93%
- This tastes good. - It's amazing.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.560 line:93%
It would be good if we put rice in it too.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.259 line:93%
- I can taste the tteokbokki sauce. - Right.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.129 line:93%
(Amazing)

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.129 line:93%
(This is so tasty.)

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:09.570 line:93%
(Feeling so happy)

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:16.210 line:93%
(They feel happy as they fill their stomachs.)

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.279 line:93%
(The youngest had finished the bowl instantly.)

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:20.879 line:93%
If you...

00:10:21.649 --> 00:10:25.019 line:93%
sleep on a warm floor after eating, your face gets swollen.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.759 line:93%
It doesn't matter.

00:10:31.129 --> 00:10:32.889 line:93%
- I think I can clear it up. - Of course.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:37.100 line:93%
(Accordingly...)

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.169 line:93%
(Seong Jae, the youngest, starts the finishing the food.)

00:10:39.169 --> 00:10:40.499 line:93%
It's so good.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.769 line:93%
- This is so tasty. - Right.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.840 line:93%
I think you're saying that it is tasty without even chewing.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.210 line:93%
(Feeling the taste without chewing the food)

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:54.820 line:93%
(Such an emotional meal..)

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.019 line:93%
(that brings heartrending eyes with hoppang)

00:10:57.019 --> 00:10:58.220 line:93%
(Gourmand of emotion, Gourmand Seong Jae)

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.249 line:93%
Eat more.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.720 line:93%
(He eats very well.)

00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:10.830 line:93%
- Seong Jae eats well. - I know.

00:11:11.029 --> 00:11:13.169 line:93%
- I didn't know he eats so well. - Me neither.

00:11:13.169 --> 00:11:14.899 line:93%
At his age, he should eat a lot.

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:17.070 line:93%
- I used to eat a lot at that age. - Of course.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.710 line:93%
- I used to eat a lot like him too. - It's so tasty.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.279 line:93%
- Am I the only one eating now? - What?

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.909 line:93%
Go ahead and finish it.

00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:25.980 line:93%
Watching you eat makes me full.

00:11:26.009 --> 00:11:28.320 line:93%
Have you ever been chubby before?

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.289 line:93%
When I was little, I used to be somewhat chubby.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.259 line:93%
But all of it went to my height.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.659 line:93%
In 2 months, I grew 20cm taller.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.600 line:93%
- In 2 months? - When I entered junior high...

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.100 line:93%
- 20cm? - That's incredible.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.330 line:93%
Seriously, that's incredible.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.570 line:93%
- How tall are you? - I am 179cm tall.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.269 line:93%
- How about you? - I am 182cm tall.

00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:50.340 line:93%
- How about you? - I am 185cm tall.

00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:54.039 line:93%
I am 137cm tall.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.879 line:93%
Do you want a lower number?

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.720 line:93%
137cm tall?

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.350 line:93%
(Their stomach is full,)

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.749 line:93%
(and they are having a good time.)

00:12:05.749 --> 00:12:07.820 line:93%
I learned a lot of things today.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.460 line:93%
(Seong Jae learned something today.)

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.590 line:93%
What?

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.730 line:93%
Learning a lot doesn't make you full.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.799 line:93%
Of course. That's true.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.570 line:93%
They say reading is the food of your mind.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.039 line:93%
- No. - It's not true.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.570 line:93%
They say it feeds your soul.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.509 line:93%
You have to actually eat the book to be full.

00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:31.279 line:93%
(They learned that they have to eat to survive.)

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.490 line:93%
(It's 4 hours before the master wakes up.)

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.820 line:93%
By the way, a lot of my preconceptions...

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.590 line:93%
about In Kwon as a singer...

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.230 line:93%
have been shattered.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.860 line:93%
- Same here. - Completely.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.029 line:93%
He's warm-hearted. That's the most important.

00:12:51.029 --> 00:12:53.129 line:93%
When he took off his sunglasses...

00:12:53.429 --> 00:12:54.600 line:93%
He was so cute.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.840 line:93%
- He's Lovely Spot. - Lovely Spot.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.570 line:93%
Without the sunglasses, he looks really naive.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.610 line:93%
He looks naive.

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:03.539 line:93%
I asked him a while ago...

00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:06.549 line:93%
why he insists on wearing sunglasses.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.590 line:93%
At first, he started wearing them to hide the fact...

00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:12.919 line:93%
- that he lacked confidence. - Is that right?

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:17.090 line:93%
(They weren't aware of the emotions...)

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.799 line:93%
(hidden behind his sunglasses.)

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:23.600 line:93%
(The sunglasses, which hid his insecurity,)

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.970 line:93%
(became part of him as time passed.)

00:13:26.999 --> 00:13:30.139 line:93%
(They're sleeping together.)

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:34.009 line:93%
(They're zoned out.)

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.279 line:93%
(The children who've been eating...)

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:42.549 line:93%
(have no worries.)

00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:43.549 line:93%
I...

00:13:45.249 --> 00:13:47.190 line:93%
think I can sleep, now that I have eaten.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.789 line:93%
- I am getting sleepy too. - Right.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.289 line:93%
I'm glad it's not just me.

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:53.129 line:93%
I wasn't saying anything because you might...

00:13:53.129 --> 00:13:55.060 line:93%
blame me if I say I'm sleepy.

00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:56.759 line:93%
But the big brother has said it.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.970 line:93%
I am so happy right now.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.970 line:93%
We ate good food, and I feel warm.

00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:03.039 line:93%
You're going to set the alarm, right?

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:04.110 line:93%
- I am going to set it. - Okay.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.539 line:93%
- We should wake up before him. - Yes.

00:14:06.539 --> 00:14:08.539 line:93%
Maybe this will happen.

00:14:08.539 --> 00:14:11.210 line:93%
He said he would wake up at 4am,

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.879 line:93%
but he might wake up at 10am.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.980 line:93%
"It's been ages since I slept so well."

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.249 line:93%
(Not wanting to get up early,)

00:14:20.249 --> 00:14:21.289 line:93%
How did I sleep so well?

00:14:21.289 --> 00:14:24.190 line:93%
(they're imagining a ridiculous situation.)

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.990 line:93%
We can just say bye and leave.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.029 line:93%
- Let's sleep. - Okay.

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:31.269 line:93%
- Good night. - I feel so happy.

00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:33.940 line:93%
- Good night. - Good night.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.940 line:93%
Okay.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.110 line:93%
It's cold.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.710 line:93%
(Seung Gi joins the master.)

00:14:46.249 --> 00:14:48.320 line:93%
(He's still...)

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.279 line:93%
(sleeping with the sunglasses.)

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.090 line:93%
(When he comes into the master's room,)

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.129 line:93%
(he remembers the pain again.)

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:06.929 line:93%
(They played a game to choose the master's roommate.)

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.139 line:93%
(He tried to let Se Hyeong have the honor.)

00:15:11.139 --> 00:15:14.139 line:93%
(But he miserably failed.)

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.350 line:93%
(And Seung Gi's turn came.)

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.450 line:93%
(Seong Jae's finger flick...)

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.289 line:93%
(made him shout.)

00:15:26.789 --> 00:15:29.889 line:93%
(He had trusted Seong Jae,)

00:15:29.889 --> 00:15:33.330 line:93%
(so it was twice more painful.)

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.399 line:93%
My gosh.

00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:38.029 line:93%
(He got paid for his betrayal...)

00:15:38.029 --> 00:15:39.499 line:93%
I think it's dented.

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:44.210 line:93%
(with a chance to share the room with the master.)

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.480 line:93%
(He lies down to sleep.)

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.249 line:93%
(But he can't forget how happy Seong Jae was.)

00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:57.490 line:93%
(He quietly kicks his blanket.)

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.720 line:93%
(When will I have another chance to sleep here?)

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.460 line:93%
(He snores loudly, and it surprises Seung Gi.)

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.100 line:93%
(Laughing)

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.029 line:93%
(Snoring)

00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:14.700 line:93%
(I hate finger flicking.)

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.370 line:93%
(I will win next time.)

00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:22.509 line:93%
(Meanwhile, these people are full and warm.)

00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:24.009 line:93%
- This is amazing. - Great.

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:25.480 line:93%
This is great.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.950 line:93%
(They are happy.)

00:16:28.149 --> 00:16:29.220 line:93%
Will he...

00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:31.019 line:93%
wake up at 4am?

00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:34.060 line:93%
(Will the master wake up at 4am?)

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.490 line:93%
(He said they should...)

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:38.730 line:93%
(try waking up at 4am.)

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.129 line:93%
(He loves it.)

00:16:41.129 --> 00:16:42.600 line:93%
It's amazing.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.129 line:93%
(I'm curious what it's like to wake up at 4am.)

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.370 line:93%
I set the alarm to 3:50am.

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:50.269 line:93%
I am going to call Seung Gi when I wake up.

00:16:50.669 --> 00:16:51.810 line:93%
Okay.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.340 line:93%
- Good night. - Good night.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.749 line:93%
(Seong Jae sets the alarm, and Sang Yun goes to bed.)

00:16:58.749 --> 00:17:00.310 line:93%
By the way, you eat so well.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.949 line:93%
I could eat more.

00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:05.320 line:93%
Really? You eat so well.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.550 line:93%
(He should've realized it then.)

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.659 line:93%
- I really like eating too. - Right.

00:17:09.659 --> 00:17:10.959 line:93%
I eat a lot.

00:17:11.729 --> 00:17:14.800 line:93%
It's really fascinating. When I turned 35...

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.330 line:93%
That's about two years ago.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.070 line:93%
I suddenly started...

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.070 line:93%
(Once upon a time, there lived Sang Yun.)

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:21.570 line:93%
getting filled up really quickly.

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:23.270 line:93%
(And his stomach shrunk at the age of 35.)

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.510 line:93%
I think you eat less when you get older.

00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:26.969 line:93%
(When you get older, you eat less.)

00:17:26.969 --> 00:17:29.010 line:93%
(It's sad. I used to eat...)

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.610 line:93%
(a whole box of large...)

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:31.979 line:93%
(or family size pizza by myself.)

00:17:31.979 --> 00:17:33.010 line:93%
(I still eat a lot of meat,)

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.080 line:93%
(but I can't eat as much as I used to.)

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.520 line:93%
(I guess I am old.)

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.620 line:93%
(Is he done now?)

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.659 line:93%
You're 23.

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:41.790 line:93%
(He opens his eyes.)

00:17:43.219 --> 00:17:47.090 line:93%
(I heard that idol groups nowadays are in their 20s or teens.)

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.360 line:93%
I think they are amazing.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.870 line:93%
I think it's amazing...

00:17:51.199 --> 00:17:54.169 line:93%
that they can achieve so much at that young age.

00:17:54.939 --> 00:17:57.610 line:93%
These days, it's very different from the past.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.239 line:93%
You don't go through puberty in middle or high school.

00:18:02.139 --> 00:18:04.879 line:93%
(It's not what they achieve that I admire.)

00:18:04.879 --> 00:18:06.979 line:93%
(I think it's amazing that they function as adults.)

00:18:06.979 --> 00:18:09.179 line:93%
(When I was their age, I didn't know anything.)

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.189 line:93%
I was reading the script I got.

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:19.290 line:93%
It was about someone strange...

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.129 line:93%
- showing up at your door. - Brothers.

00:18:21.129 --> 00:18:22.199 line:93%
Are you ready to sleep?

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.899 line:93%
I was ready a long time ago.

00:18:23.899 --> 00:18:25.030 line:93%
- Okay. - Are you ready?

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.100 line:93%
Yes.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.199 line:93%
I will turn the lights off.

00:18:29.199 --> 00:18:30.510 line:93%
Good night.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.310 line:93%
- Good night. - Cheers.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.340 line:93%
(Does he always sleep sideways?)

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.010 line:93%
Good night.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.110 line:93%
(Sang Yun's storytelling ends too.)

00:18:39.379 --> 00:18:42.280 line:93%
(I'll see you at 4am, boys.)

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.419 line:93%
(What would it be like to wake up at 4am?)

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.260 line:93%
(People rush to get home,)

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.860 line:93%
(and the moon shines bright.)

00:18:55.399 --> 00:18:59.570 line:93%
(Tired and exhausted, everyone falls asleep.)

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.610 line:93%
(And it's finally 4am.)

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:13.949 line:93%
(Seong Jae's alarm goes off.)

00:19:13.949 --> 00:19:16.280 line:93%
I am going to call Seung Gi when I wake up.

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:20.320 line:93%
(Seung Gi, did master get up?)

00:19:21.959 --> 00:19:23.830 line:93%
(The phone buzzes with Seong Jae's message.)

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:27.659 line:93%
(But Seung Gi doesn't wake up.)

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:33.330 line:93%
(The master gave his word.)

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.310 line:93%
(He said he makes sure that he wakes up at 4am.)

00:19:38.409 --> 00:19:41.239 line:93%
(But he's still sleeping.)

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.709 line:93%
Is he not up?

00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:44.010 line:93%
He's not replying.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.850 line:93%
(Se Hyeong laughs.)

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.280 line:93%
I set the alarm to 5am.

00:19:50.419 --> 00:19:52.949 line:93%
(1 hour later)

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.860 line:93%
(Seong Jae's alarm goes off again.)

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.030 line:93%
(He hasn't replied yet.)

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.939 line:93%
(Seung Gi, it's Se Hyeong. Is something wrong?)

00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:16.939 line:93%
(Curious, Se Hyeong sends Seung Gi a message.)

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.919 line:93%
(Finally, Seung Gi wakes up.)

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.219 line:93%
(Is it 5am?)

00:20:26.189 --> 00:20:28.260 line:93%
(He gets surprised and wakes up.)

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.659 line:93%
(But the master is still sleeping.)

00:20:29.659 --> 00:20:30.790 line:93%
Master.

00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:34.399 line:93%
(Seung Gi carefully calls him.)

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:35.500 line:93%
Master.

00:20:37.429 --> 00:20:38.429 line:93%
(Shouldn't you wake up? It's 5am.)

00:20:38.429 --> 00:20:41.139 line:93%
You should wake up.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.040 line:93%
You have to wake up.

00:20:45.439 --> 00:20:47.540 line:93%
(I don't want to.)

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.050 line:93%
He became one with the bed.

00:20:54.979 --> 00:20:57.080 line:93%
The master isn't waking up.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.419 line:93%
He didn't become one with his house.

00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:03.389 line:93%
He became one with his bed.

00:21:06.489 --> 00:21:09.300 line:93%
(Se Hyeong doesn't know what's going on.)

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.870 line:93%
(He goes to their room with a swollen face.)

00:21:16.739 --> 00:21:17.810 line:93%
Seung Gi.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.409 line:93%
(Is he still not up?)

00:21:22.409 --> 00:21:23.979 line:93%
(He's not up.)

00:21:23.979 --> 00:21:25.580 line:93%
(He's snoring.)

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.679 line:93%
(The master snores loudly.)

00:21:28.649 --> 00:21:31.820 line:93%
(What happened to you, sir?)

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.750 line:93%
(He clearly said...)

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:37.060 line:93%
(that he would make sure to wake up at 4am.)

00:21:39.689 --> 00:21:42.459 line:93%
(He made sure we get up at 4am too.)

00:21:42.729 --> 00:21:44.699 line:93%
You've been sleeping for nine hours.

00:21:45.729 --> 00:21:46.770 line:93%
(It's past 6am.)

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:47.770 line:93%
Master.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.739 line:93%
(Sometimes I wake up at midnight,)

00:21:52.739 --> 00:21:54.510 line:93%
(and I feel so lucky.)

00:21:55.239 --> 00:21:57.250 line:93%
We are not sleepy anymore.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.649 line:93%
(We've been fooled.)

00:21:59.209 --> 00:22:00.250 line:93%
Master.

00:22:01.379 --> 00:22:03.350 line:93%
I think it's going to be like what I predicted yesterday.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.219 line:93%
He said he would wake up at 4am,

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.219 line:93%
but he might wake up at 10am and say...

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.629 line:93%
"It's been ages since I slept so well."

00:22:11.629 --> 00:22:14.729 line:93%
(Will Se Hyeong's imagination come true?)

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.469 line:93%
Master. Master.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.300 line:93%
(He wriggles.)

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.770 line:93%
- Are you up? - Yes. I'm up.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:23.770 line:93%
(He finally got up.)

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:25.340 line:93%
- What time is it? - It's...

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.979 line:93%
(What time is it?)

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.280 line:93%
It's 6:30am.

00:22:33.979 --> 00:22:35.350 line:93%
(What?)

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.250 line:93%
(6:30am?)

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.919 line:93%
- It's 6:30am. - How can it be so late?

00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:42.719 line:93%
You were sleeping too well.

00:22:43.989 --> 00:22:46.689 line:93%
- You should've woke me up. - We...

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.629 line:93%
- Are you feeling well? - I am good.

00:22:50.399 --> 00:22:53.100 line:93%
- Did you sleep well? - We have to leave.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.899 line:93%
- We just got up too. - What?

00:22:55.969 --> 00:22:57.909 line:93%
We just got up.

00:22:57.939 --> 00:22:59.270 line:93%
I see.

00:22:59.739 --> 00:23:01.340 line:93%
We slept well.

00:23:02.209 --> 00:23:04.350 line:93%
What time did I sleep last night?

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.850 line:93%
You went to bed at 9am.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.050 line:93%
(Seung Gi understands the master even if he's babbling.)

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.750 line:93%
- He slept for 9 and a half hours. - Yes.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.620 line:93%
(The master slept for 9 and a half hours.)

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.790 line:93%
(Where are my sunglasses?)

00:23:18.629 --> 00:23:21.129 line:93%
He's up. Master.

00:23:21.129 --> 00:23:22.500 line:93%
(Finally, the master comes out to the living room.)

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.100 line:93%
- I woke up late. - You're up. Good morning!

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.370 line:93%
Good morning.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.340 line:93%
It's so late. It's too late.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.510 line:93%
Master. Master...

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.669 line:93%
You look too well.

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:35.080 line:93%
- Do I? - Yes.

00:23:35.379 --> 00:23:38.050 line:93%
You look a lot better right now.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.350 line:93%
Who slept beside me?

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.080 line:93%
(What?)

00:23:42.719 --> 00:23:43.989 line:93%
I did.

00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:47.889 line:93%
He didn't even know who was in his room.

00:23:48.419 --> 00:23:50.629 line:93%
- I don't know. - I kept talking.

00:23:50.629 --> 00:23:52.330 line:93%
But you didn't move at all.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.399 line:93%
- Take a spoon each. - Now?

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.629 line:93%
- Take a spoon each. - Now?

00:23:57.629 --> 00:23:59.000 line:93%
- What is it for? - Are we eating?

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.300 line:93%
This...

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.669 line:93%
(Everyone gets a spoon.)

00:24:09.179 --> 00:24:10.580 line:93%
Where did the opened one go?

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.949 line:93%
(It shocks everyone.)

00:24:13.179 --> 00:24:15.320 line:93%
I got it from a good place.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.620 line:93%
Are you going to eat that now?

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.620 line:93%
(What is that?)

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.020 line:93%
(It's mysterious powder.)

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.090 line:93%
(What is this powder?)

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.489 line:93%
- I didn't know what it was. - Is it instant coffee?

00:24:26.489 --> 00:24:27.729 line:93%
It's honey powder.

00:24:27.729 --> 00:24:30.030 line:93%
It's high in calorie. He's got five bags.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.129 line:93%
And he already had quite a bit.

00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:35.600 line:93%
(We had...)

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.409 line:93%
(forgotten about it.)

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.840 line:93%
(I haven't even had the chance to wash my face.)

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.310 line:93%
(And we are going to eat honey powder?)

00:24:42.479 --> 00:24:44.449 line:93%
Since when did you start taking this?

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.949 line:93%
It's been about nine months.

00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:49.949 line:93%
You've been up for only about seven minutes.

00:24:49.949 --> 00:24:51.389 line:93%
Is it okay to eat that?

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.290 line:93%
- It's different from honey. - It's from a factory.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.489 line:93%
Do you just take it as it is?

00:24:56.489 --> 00:24:57.929 line:93%
(Do you just eat it?)

00:24:58.889 --> 00:25:02.100 line:93%
(I won't explain it any further.)

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.129 line:93%
(He puts honey powder...)

00:25:06.129 --> 00:25:08.000 line:93%
(on his dry mouth.)

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.040 line:93%
When you take it moderately, it's really good for you.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.040 line:93%
- Is it? - It says there's no fat.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.979 line:93%
Doesn't it say that it's good for your health?

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.580 line:93%
Did someone say it's good for your health?

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.449 line:93%
- Yes. - Is it a placebo effect?

00:25:22.949 --> 00:25:24.419 line:93%
Stop looking at it.

00:25:24.719 --> 00:25:25.820 line:93%
Just trust me and eat it.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.120 line:93%
Okay.

00:25:28.719 --> 00:25:30.120 line:93%
It's a spoonful.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.530 line:93%
(He takes one more spoonful...)

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.330 line:93%
He took another spoonful.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:34.530 line:93%
(to get rid of the suspicion.)

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:35.530 line:93%
Go ahead.

00:25:36.699 --> 00:25:37.830 line:93%
Should we take one spoonful each?

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.570 line:93%
(They eat breakfast in the master's way.)

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.739 line:93%
(He sums up all the moisture in his mouth...)

00:25:44.739 --> 00:25:48.139 line:93%
(to understand the meaning of this breakfast.)

00:25:48.439 --> 00:25:52.149 line:93%
(The more they eat it,)

00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:55.120 line:93%
(the sweeter their mouth gets.)

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.719 line:93%
(The sweetness wakes them up.)

00:26:06.459 --> 00:26:08.629 line:93%
(It just tastes like sugar.)

00:26:10.929 --> 00:26:13.800 line:93%
Is it good for your health?

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.699 line:93%
Is eating a spoonful...

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.840 line:93%
First of all,

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.479 line:93%
(Does it have great benefits?)

00:26:22.479 --> 00:26:24.379 line:93%
it's very tasty.

00:26:24.379 --> 00:26:26.550 line:93%
(He takes it because it's tasty.)

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.580 line:93%
It's sweet. Right.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.489 line:93%
(Are you curious how sweet this honey is?)

00:26:30.489 --> 00:26:34.060 line:93%
I tastes a little bit like pumpkin malt candy.

00:26:34.889 --> 00:26:38.830 line:93%
If you only eat sweets and instant foods...

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.530 line:93%
(He only eats what tastes good.)

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.229 line:93%
Is that a one-minute breakfast?

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.729 line:93%
- What? - Is that the one-minute breakfast?

00:26:45.729 --> 00:26:47.540 line:93%
- It is. - I see.

00:26:47.899 --> 00:26:50.540 line:93%
(The master's diet)

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.469 line:93%
(He ate rice crust for yesterday's lunch and dinner.)

00:26:53.469 --> 00:26:55.110 line:93%
(And he ate honey powder for today's breakfast.)

00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:56.939 line:93%
(The "1-minute breakfast" in his time schedule)

00:26:56.939 --> 00:27:00.449 line:93%
(He finishes his breakfast.)

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.850 line:93%
Wait.

00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:07.760 line:93%
You got up and started your day as if nothing happened.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.159 line:93%
You were supposed to get up at 4am.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.830 line:93%
- A lot of time has passed. - I can't help it.

00:27:13.855 --> 00:27:15.855 line:93%
(He can't help it.)

00:27:16.659 --> 00:27:19.030 line:93%
You can't help it, but you're so cool about it.

00:27:19.429 --> 00:27:20.429 line:93%
As if you always do this.

00:27:20.429 --> 00:27:23.500 line:93%
As if it's 4:30am right now.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.939 line:93%
I said I was getting sleepy around 6pm.

00:27:26.939 --> 00:27:31.780 line:93%
So do you accept the fact that you slept for 9 and a half hours?

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.810 line:93%
I do.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.320 line:93%
I didn't know I'd sleep so well. Thank you.

00:27:40.189 --> 00:27:43.560 line:93%
I told you. I finally heard it from his mouth.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.729 line:93%
Thank you.

00:27:44.729 --> 00:27:45.989 line:93%
(Their morning is fun, thanks to the master who slept well.)

00:27:45.989 --> 00:27:48.000 line:93%
All right. I just got up.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.300 line:93%
- Okay. - Your day just began.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.500 line:93%
- Hey. - Your schedule has changed.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.739 line:93%
Whenever I wake up, I have to do this.

00:27:55.739 --> 00:27:56.770 line:93%
Oh...

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.510 line:93%
I need to do this.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.409 line:93%
You have to do that whenever you wake up.

00:28:02.409 --> 00:28:03.439 line:93%
Yes.

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:10.038 line:93%
(It's his morning routine.)
Whenever I wake up, I have to do this.

00:28:10.038 --> 00:28:11.069 line:93%
Oh...

00:28:11.069 --> 00:28:12.809 line:93%
I need to do this.

00:28:12.809 --> 00:28:16.708 line:93%
You have to do that whenever you wake up.

00:28:16.708 --> 00:28:17.738 line:93%
Yes.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.440 line:93%
You do this even if you wake up late.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.880 line:93%
- It's to sing well. - Right.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.349 line:93%
I do this to sing well.

00:28:25.349 --> 00:28:27.620 line:93%
I practice putting emphasis on different notes.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.450 line:93%
(He practices the beats.)

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.589 line:93%
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:28:35.589 --> 00:28:38.089 line:93%
1, 2, 3, 4. I do this fast.

00:28:38.589 --> 00:28:40.259 line:93%
(He tries to do it fast.)

00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:41.259 line:93%
I can't do it.

00:28:43.099 --> 00:28:45.970 line:93%
(At first, they just laughed.)

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:48.339 line:93%
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:28:48.339 --> 00:28:51.240 line:93%
(But as they concentrate on his hand,)

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:58.249 line:93%
(they become serious.)

00:29:01.249 --> 00:29:03.420 line:93%
(Every morning, he practices rhythm dynamics...)

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.589 line:93%
(with a beat machine.)

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.230 line:93%
By the way, what is that good for?

00:29:10.289 --> 00:29:12.190 line:93%
It helps you when you sing.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:13.400 line:93%
- Does it give sense of beat? - Beat.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.859 line:93%
It hones your sense of rhythm.

00:29:15.999 --> 00:29:17.499 line:93%
He practices the beats first thing in the morning.

00:29:17.499 --> 00:29:20.069 line:93%
This is my system.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.240 line:93%
I use this system...

00:29:22.499 --> 00:29:24.769 line:93%
to write music. I write music after I do this.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:27.210 line:93%
Then my hearing becomes better.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.609 line:93%
When there's the beat...

00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:32.549 line:93%
I think I get what he means.

00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:34.019 line:93%
You're right.

00:29:34.319 --> 00:29:37.450 line:93%
(In this unexpected routine of his,)

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:42.220 line:93%
(we feel his passed time.)

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.259 line:93%
Try it.

00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:44.589 line:93%
(We realize the time he has dedicated to music.)

00:29:48.123 --> 00:29:53.123 line:93%
<font color="#F1E6B2">[VIU Ver] E03 Master in the House / All the Butlers</font>
<font color="#E06287">"Shall We Disobey the Master?"</font>
<font color="#7474C1">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

00:29:57.339 --> 00:30:01.440 line:93%
(He always begins his day by practicing the basic beats.)

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.509 line:93%
(Within his eccentric look,)

00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:08.079 line:93%
(his passion for music is hidden.)

00:30:08.079 --> 00:30:11.450 line:93%
I do it for about half an hour. Then I choose a song...

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.589 line:93%
and try to practice the beats.

00:30:14.589 --> 00:30:17.390 line:93%
I practice for 2 days up to a month.

00:30:17.529 --> 00:30:20.930 line:93%
After that, I can copy it precisely.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.230 line:93%
And I...

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.930 line:93%
He practices every day at the same time...

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:27.640 line:93%
and he constantly hones his skills every day at the same time.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:31.140 line:93%
All that made him come up with the lyrics...

00:30:31.839 --> 00:30:34.009 line:93%
and great melodies.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.180 line:93%
That was a big lesson for me.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.410 line:93%
(The master became who he is as a result of consistent practice.)

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.779 line:93%
Where are you going?

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.589 line:93%
I have to exercise now.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:44.920 line:93%
Are you going to exercise?

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.460 line:93%
- Right now? - I am going to exercise.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.819 line:93%
Shouldn't you put on some clothes?

00:30:49.819 --> 00:30:51.589 line:93%
I am okay. This is enough.

00:30:51.589 --> 00:30:52.759 line:93%
(They come out without any jackets.)

00:30:52.759 --> 00:30:54.400 line:93%
It's really nice.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.370 line:93%
(They came out.)

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.900 line:93%
I don't warm-up my voice.

00:31:02.569 --> 00:31:05.370 line:93%
Feet get cold in the

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:09.809 line:93%
Feet get cold in the winter time

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.150 line:93%
- That surprised me. - The sky won't snow,

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.519 line:93%
and the sun won't shine

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.549 line:93%
(Does he do this every morning?)

00:31:18.589 --> 00:31:20.720 line:93%
From the day

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:26.859 line:93%
(But it's too cold.)

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.759 line:93%
(Their hands are freezing.)

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:31.970 line:93%
(He sniffs.)

00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:35.640 line:93%
I will go get changed.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.170 line:93%
(I will go get changed.)

00:31:37.609 --> 00:31:39.410 line:93%
He's going to get changed.

00:31:40.079 --> 00:31:43.009 line:93%
I said you should put on a jacket.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:45.109 line:93%
It's so funny.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.779 line:93%
Master.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.680 line:93%
I am ready now.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.980 line:93%
I am ready.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:51.620 line:93%
Usually...

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.359 line:93%
Practicing the beats is very helpful in doing this.

00:31:55.359 --> 00:31:56.589 line:93%
(That's why he has to practice the beats every morning.)

00:31:56.589 --> 00:31:58.529 line:93%
You don't play every beat with the same energy.

00:31:58.529 --> 00:32:00.400 line:93%
(Just like playing a drum, you need to sing with dynamics.)

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.059 line:93%
You play with dynamics.

00:32:02.059 --> 00:32:05.130 line:93%
When a non-singer hears it,

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.970 line:93%
- you wouldn't know what he means. - I don't get it.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:09.299 line:93%
- Actually. - It's about the subtle things.

00:32:09.299 --> 00:32:15.140 line:93%
I really thought he just followed his emotions and soul. But...

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.109 line:93%
I thought you were just following your emotions.

00:32:17.109 --> 00:32:18.779 line:93%
I thought you sang however you want to.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.950 line:93%
- Well... - Watch your mouth.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.319 line:93%
He looks like he's born with the talent.

00:32:23.589 --> 00:32:25.249 line:93%
He sings so effortlessly.

00:32:25.249 --> 00:32:27.420 line:93%
Ordinary people think like him.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.430 line:93%
Should we sing your song to warm up our voices?

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:34.460 line:93%
You first? Or me?

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.930 line:93%
If you sing a bar, we will try to do it.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:38.400 line:93%
Tell us what to do.

00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:43.440 line:93%
Only that is

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:48.680 line:93%
My world

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.520 line:93%
- His voice echoed in the mountains. - It's like he's singing over there.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.350 line:93%
- His voice echoed. - I know.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.060 line:93%
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - All right. Do it.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.029 line:93%
(Are you telling us to do that?)

00:33:06.459 --> 00:33:10.000 line:93%
Only that is

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000 line:93%
My world

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.270 line:93%
(He puts the emphasis on the word "that".)

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.310 line:93%
- He's good. - He's a singer.

00:33:18.839 --> 00:33:20.839 line:93%
Great. I love it.

00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:22.080 line:93%
You did so well.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.149 line:93%
Only that is

00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:29.350 line:93%
My world

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.790 line:93%
(You have to shake your hand like this.)

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.549 line:93%
He vibrated his voice in the end.

00:33:32.649 --> 00:33:34.220 line:93%
(He's memorizing it.)

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.229 line:93%
When we practice with the master,

00:33:37.229 --> 00:33:38.589 line:93%
- It's... - it's different, isn't it?

00:33:38.589 --> 00:33:39.689 line:93%
We...

00:33:39.689 --> 00:33:41.060 line:93%
There's no limit.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.100 line:93%
You just do it without setting a limit.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:44.669 line:93%
I get it now.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.500 line:93%
Next is Sang Yun. He's the smart one.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.299 line:93%
He must be analyzing it.

00:33:48.299 --> 00:33:50.740 line:93%
He's done analyzing everything.

00:33:50.939 --> 00:33:52.009 line:93%
I have to shake my hand.

00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:54.310 line:93%
(First, he shakes his hand.)

00:33:56.109 --> 00:33:57.750 line:93%
(Second,)

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.180 line:93%
(he musters up his courage.)

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.990 line:93%
Only that is

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:08.689 line:93%
My world

00:34:08.689 --> 00:34:10.129 line:93%
- He's good. - Great.

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.160 line:93%
(He successfully sang it!)

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.700 line:93%
- He's really good. - He's really good.

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.830 line:93%
- He... - I got touched a little.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.370 line:93%
Why are you good at everything?

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.200 line:93%
I told you he finished analyzing it.

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.569 line:93%
He studied everything.

00:34:21.569 --> 00:34:22.700 line:93%
He did really well.

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.240 line:93%
(The master is satisfied.)

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:26.470 line:93%
At first, I just thought...

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:32.180 line:93%
it would be like shouting loudly.

00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:34.450 line:93%
But I saw the master...

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:37.919 line:93%
putting the emphasis on the word "that".

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.390 line:93%
(He analyzed the dynamics.)

00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:43.359 line:93%
(He managed to copy the master.)

00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:44.560 line:93%
That's how I was able to do well.

00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:48.799 line:93%
(It's Se Hyeong's turn.)

00:34:50.899 --> 00:34:54.069 line:93%
(He always wanted...)

00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:57.109 line:93%
(to be the master's first pupil.)

00:34:57.209 --> 00:35:00.779 line:93%
(He even prepared a secret gift.)

00:35:00.779 --> 00:35:05.950 line:93%
(He tried so hard to win the master's love.)

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.020 line:93%
(He is determined to win the master's approval.)

00:35:12.319 --> 00:35:16.089 line:93%
Only that is

00:35:18.259 --> 00:35:19.259 line:93%
(He takes a breath.)

00:35:19.259 --> 00:35:23.160 line:93%
My world

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.330 line:93%
(He farts.)

00:35:25.799 --> 00:35:28.339 line:93%
- I think he farted. - I think he farted.

00:35:28.339 --> 00:35:29.370 line:93%
You farted, didn't you?

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:31.109 line:93%
- You farted. - I heard it.

00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:32.270 line:93%
- I heard it. - It was like a drum sound.

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:34.310 line:93%
- I didn't. I didn't fart. - You did.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.810 line:93%
- Then did the master fart? - Yes.

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:38.810 line:93%
- Me? What did I do? - It's nothing.

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:40.520 line:93%
- Did you fart when I was singing? - Everyone heard it.

00:35:40.779 --> 00:35:43.080 line:93%
- You farted. - I didn't fart.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.649 line:93%
- I didn't fart. - I didn't fart either.

00:35:44.649 --> 00:35:46.890 line:93%
He should've sang the line in one go.

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:48.459 line:93%
(But he took a breath in the middle.)

00:35:48.459 --> 00:35:50.290 line:93%
- He did that. - No.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:54.259 line:93%
My world

00:35:54.259 --> 00:35:57.899 line:93%
(Everything points to Se Hyeong.)

00:35:57.899 --> 00:35:59.899 line:93%
- You farted, didn't you? - I think you did.

00:35:59.899 --> 00:36:01.270 line:93%
- You mean you did? - It wasn't me.

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:02.770 line:93%
I didn't fart. I think you farted.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.640 line:93%
It was so loud.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:06.640 line:93%
- It was so loud. - You heard it, didn't you?

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.410 line:93%
- You farted. - You heard it, didn't you?

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.910 line:93%
(He ends up losing his place as the master's favorite pupil.)

00:36:11.649 --> 00:36:13.450 line:93%
- Let's go in. - Let's go inside.

00:36:13.879 --> 00:36:15.350 line:93%
Is this lesson done?

00:36:16.479 --> 00:36:18.950 line:93%
- I... I did. - You gained confidence.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.459 line:93%
I suddenly felt it.

00:36:20.689 --> 00:36:22.359 line:93%
It had strange energy.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.160 line:93%
- We have to wash now. - Yes.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.200 line:93%
We have to wash.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.799 line:93%
I heard you wash your face in one minute.

00:36:29.799 --> 00:36:31.799 line:93%
When I am in a hurry,

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:33.270 line:93%
I just wash my face anywhere.

00:36:34.569 --> 00:36:36.770 line:93%
We usually do this, you know? You just wash your face anywhere.

00:36:37.939 --> 00:36:39.009 line:93%
Are you now...

00:36:39.009 --> 00:36:40.410 line:93%
(A master doesn't blame his tools.)

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:42.879 line:93%
Are you washing your face now?

00:36:42.879 --> 00:36:44.410 line:93%
(The master doesn't mind where he washes his face.)

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:46.720 line:93%
Don't you use soap?

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.649 line:93%
You go to the bathroom throughout the day.

00:36:49.649 --> 00:36:50.649 line:93%
True.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:54.160 line:93%
I can wash my face then again.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.990 line:93%
Are you done?

00:36:56.259 --> 00:36:57.790 line:93%
It just needs to wake me up.

00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:59.660 line:93%
It took him 10 seconds.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.629 line:93%
10.3 seconds.

00:37:01.629 --> 00:37:02.830 line:93%
It took him 10.3 seconds.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:04.330 line:93%
I did really well.

00:37:04.729 --> 00:37:06.529 line:93%
You should wash your face too.

00:37:06.629 --> 00:37:08.370 line:93%
- We have to copy him. - This is also...

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:10.009 line:93%
a little bit...

00:37:10.009 --> 00:37:12.669 line:93%
Just like his singing practice,

00:37:12.669 --> 00:37:14.439 line:93%
- that must have a meaning too. - Yes.

00:37:14.439 --> 00:37:16.680 line:93%
I think he does it to wake his senses.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.549 line:93%
I will start the timer when you turn on the water.

00:37:18.549 --> 00:37:20.379 line:93%
Although I am not sure why I have to do this.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:22.120 line:93%
But I will try it.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:23.319 line:93%
Wait.

00:37:23.319 --> 00:37:25.020 line:93%
(He copies the master's lifestyle.)

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.089 line:93%
Give me the sign.

00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:27.160 line:93%
Ready.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.790 line:93%
(He's not sure what's good about it, but he goes for it.)

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:30.930 line:93%
Start.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:34.459 line:93%
How many seconds did I spend?

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:36.560 line:93%
- 5 seconds passed. - 5 seconds.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.330 line:93%
(He brushes his teeth with his right hand.)

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.899 line:93%
(He washes his face with his left hand.)

00:37:40.899 --> 00:37:41.899 line:93%
How many seconds?

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:44.410 line:93%
- 15 seconds. - 15 seconds.

00:37:44.839 --> 00:37:46.169 line:93%
Yes.

00:37:46.169 --> 00:37:48.310 line:93%
- It only took me 10 seconds. - Yes.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:49.839 line:93%
How many seconds?

00:37:51.049 --> 00:37:54.819 line:93%
(He washes his face and rinses his mouth at the same time.)

00:37:54.819 --> 00:37:56.549 line:93%
You have 10 seconds.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:03.959 line:93%
How many seconds?

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.229 line:93%
- It's nearly a minute. - It's over.

00:38:07.459 --> 00:38:08.500 line:93%
That's it.

00:38:09.229 --> 00:38:10.229 line:93%
- That's it. - Perfect.

00:38:10.229 --> 00:38:12.000 line:93%
I finished it in a minute.

00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:14.540 line:93%
He can finish in a minute.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.910 line:93%
But since the master only took 10 seconds,

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.509 line:93%
let's finish in 10 seconds.

00:38:18.509 --> 00:38:20.580 line:93%
(He suggests that they finish washing in 10 seconds.)

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.180 line:93%
- Brushing the teeth too? - Yes.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.109 line:93%
- It's... - Thank goodness.

00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:27.520 line:93%
useless otherwise.

00:38:28.049 --> 00:38:31.149 line:93%
We have to brush our teeth too? You're joking, right?

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.390 line:93%
He finished in 10 seconds, so we should finish in 10 seconds.

00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:37.689 line:93%
Start the timer when I begin.

00:38:37.689 --> 00:38:38.790 line:93%
(Se Hyeong will try washing his face in 10 seconds.)

00:38:40.529 --> 00:38:41.560 line:93%
Are you ready?

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.430 line:93%
Stop the water when it turns 10 seconds.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.040 line:93%
I will set the timer.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.970 line:93%
Okay. Here we go.

00:38:49.339 --> 00:38:51.569 line:93%
Ready and go.

00:38:52.709 --> 00:38:56.479 line:93%
(10, 9, 8, 7,)

00:38:56.479 --> 00:39:02.479 line:93%
(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

00:39:02.479 --> 00:39:03.549 line:93%
The end.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.819 line:93%
I am done.

00:39:05.819 --> 00:39:07.160 line:93%
What was that?

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.490 line:93%
(I'm done.)

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.660 line:93%
You're not done.

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.359 line:93%
You still have toothpaste.

00:39:13.359 --> 00:39:14.930 line:93%
You have toothpaste on your teeth.

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:16.500 line:93%
It feels very refreshing right now.

00:39:16.529 --> 00:39:17.529 line:93%
It really does.

00:39:17.529 --> 00:39:20.270 line:93%
The toothpaste on your teeth makes your teeth so white.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.169 line:93%
It feels so refreshing.

00:39:22.169 --> 00:39:23.540 line:93%
You can't swallow it.

00:39:23.669 --> 00:39:24.770 line:93%
It feels really refreshing.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:26.209 line:93%
You have toothpaste on your teeth.

00:39:28.209 --> 00:39:30.479 line:93%
No, it really is refreshing.

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:31.979 line:93%
I can wipe this, right?

00:39:33.009 --> 00:39:34.180 line:93%
What?

00:39:35.279 --> 00:39:36.580 line:93%
But it really feels refreshing.

00:39:36.649 --> 00:39:38.020 line:93%
Since I hurried...

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.160 line:93%
When I hurry,

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:41.890 line:93%
I feel like a...

00:39:42.259 --> 00:39:44.560 line:93%
- diligent person. - A diligent person.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.729 line:93%
I feel like a busy person.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.100 line:93%
I finished it in 10 seconds.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.330 line:93%
You're next, Sang Yun.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:51.899 line:93%
He finished in 10 seconds, so we should finish in 10 seconds.

00:39:51.899 --> 00:39:54.470 line:93%
It's going to be tough with bamboo salt toothpaste.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.839 line:93%
You have to rinse it at least twice. It hurts otherwise.

00:39:56.839 --> 00:39:57.939 line:93%
Okay, come.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:59.410 line:93%
Here we go.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.609 line:93%
Wait.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.950 line:93%
(He's very serious.)

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.250 line:93%
There are many moments when I don't know what to do.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:09.520 line:93%
(He's worried about how to be on a variety show.)

00:40:09.779 --> 00:40:10.919 line:93%
10 seconds.

00:40:10.919 --> 00:40:12.319 line:93%
- Wait. - 10 seconds.

00:40:12.319 --> 00:40:14.720 line:93%
(Why is this so nerve-racking?)

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:16.259 line:93%
- Start. - I think he will succeed it.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:19.660 line:93%
(He brushes his teeth like crazy.)

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.060 line:93%
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:24.799 line:93%
5, 4,

00:40:25.169 --> 00:40:29.040 line:93%
3, 2, 1.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.339 line:93%
Time's up.

00:40:31.169 --> 00:40:32.839 line:93%
(Everything was calculated.)

00:40:32.839 --> 00:40:34.910 line:93%
- Wait, hang on. - Did you swallow the water?

00:40:35.509 --> 00:40:37.310 line:93%
- Wait, hang on. - Did you swallow the water?

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.709 line:93%
Show us your teeth.

00:40:39.149 --> 00:40:42.520 line:93%
(Did Sang Yun succeed too?)

00:40:42.979 --> 00:40:44.620 line:93%
- Open your mouth. - Oh, you're...

00:40:45.319 --> 00:40:50.930 line:93%
(We see a little bit of his bamboo salt toothpaste.)

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.899 line:93%
There are still so many moments when I just don't know what to do.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.330 line:93%
Hey, there's a chunk of toothpaste left in his mouth.

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:58.370 line:93%
Gosh, there's still so much toothpaste left.

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.839 line:93%
- Sang Yun. - Why did I use the bamboo salt one?

00:41:01.669 --> 00:41:03.439 line:93%
- Rinse your mouth. - All right.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:05.310 line:93%
But you know what?

00:41:05.509 --> 00:41:07.439 line:93%
Just having some toothpaste in your mouth...

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.709 line:93%
refreshes you.

00:41:09.439 --> 00:41:11.180 line:93%
- I'm serious. - It's because you ate it.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.250 line:93%
No, I didn't eat it.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:13.549 line:93%
It got stuck between your teeth.

00:41:14.279 --> 00:41:17.450 line:93%
It's... There must be a reason why he does it this way, right?

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.589 line:93%
No. I really don't think there's no reason.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.359 line:93%
- Master. - I put my scarf on. What's up?

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:25.560 line:93%
Is there a specific reason why you wash up...

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.560 line:93%
this quickly in the morning?

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.729 line:93%
(He asks the master why he does it.)

00:41:29.529 --> 00:41:35.439 line:93%
I feel like doing things quickly creates more time for me to use.

00:41:35.439 --> 00:41:37.270 line:93%
I'll be 80 in no time, you know.

00:41:38.209 --> 00:41:40.839 line:93%
I think you can spare five more minutes to wash up properly.

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:42.439 line:93%
I'm thinking that...

00:41:42.439 --> 00:41:45.049 line:93%
he could've done everything if he only woke up 30 minutes early.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:47.620 line:93%
He could've done a lot more things.

00:41:48.319 --> 00:41:51.819 line:93%
(Is spending time on things other than music a luxury to him?)

00:41:51.819 --> 00:41:53.759 line:93%
(Thanks to the master who slept in,)

00:41:53.919 --> 00:41:56.589 line:93%
(they had to rush the whole morning.)

00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:58.859 line:93%
(Now, it's time to recharge.)

00:41:59.729 --> 00:42:01.560 line:93%
Can we take a little break now?

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.160 line:93%
- You should eat breakfast. - We'll cook.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.069 line:93%
Master, you should take a break until we get breakfast ready.

00:42:06.169 --> 00:42:07.200 line:93%
Okay.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.240 line:93%
(They prepared a surprise gift...)

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.109 line:93%
(for their master who lives on rice crust.)

00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:11.410 line:93%
Is this it?

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:13.069 line:93%
I think it is.

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:14.609 line:93%
Take care of this for me.

00:42:14.609 --> 00:42:15.779 line:93%
(A warm home-cooked meal)

00:42:17.209 --> 00:42:21.279 line:93%
(All of this was planned by one person.)

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:25.549 line:93%
(House Cook Master Yang)

00:42:25.649 --> 00:42:28.959 line:93%
(He wanted to cook a meal for the master.)

00:42:28.959 --> 00:42:31.790 line:93%
(I'm sorry. I didn't really notice you until now.)

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:34.560 line:93%
(Only look at me from now on.)

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:37.970 line:93%
(All he needs is the master's love.)

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:41.700 line:93%
(Head Chef, Yang Se Hyeong)

00:42:43.339 --> 00:42:45.439 line:93%
(He goes through the fridge and decides what to make.)

00:42:45.439 --> 00:42:46.810 line:93%
There's something else inside.

00:42:50.279 --> 00:42:52.149 line:93%
Honey powder is everywhere.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.620 line:93%
Honey powder is all over the place.

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.850 line:93%
(Is it like rice crust?)

00:42:56.649 --> 00:42:58.250 line:93%
Shall I make stir-fried fishcakes?

00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:59.350 line:93%
(He can whip out recipes right away.)

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:01.459 line:93%
Shall I make a rolled omelet?

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.560 line:93%
There's radish. It makes refreshing broth.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.589 line:93%
Carrots and onions.

00:43:09.299 --> 00:43:10.299 line:93%
(Every dish starts with this.)

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.629 line:93%
I need to fill this with water. Excuse me for a second.

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.339 line:93%
I'll start the broth first because it takes the longest to make.

00:43:18.009 --> 00:43:19.310 line:93%
(He puts in ingredients for broth.)

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:22.410 line:93%
It has ingredients like herring, shrimp, and anchovies.

00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:25.049 line:93%
We need to make rice too.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:26.779 line:93%
There's a lot to do.

00:43:26.779 --> 00:43:28.220 line:93%
I'll wash the rice cooker and pot first.

00:43:28.279 --> 00:43:30.919 line:93%
Yes. I'll appreciate that.

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:32.790 line:93%
(Sang Yun comes in.)

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:33.959 line:93%
Can I help you guys with anything?

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.830 line:93%
Oh, if you want to help out, you can peel the radish.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.359 line:93%
Peel the radish for me.

00:43:38.359 --> 00:43:41.029 line:93%
And these onions... Do you know how to peel them?

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.830 line:93%
- Yes. - Good. Just do those two things.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:43.899 line:93%
Okay.

00:43:43.899 --> 00:43:45.270 line:93%
Sit there and make yourself comfortable.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:48.270 line:93%
Sang Yun, you probably make western-style food most of the time.

00:43:48.399 --> 00:43:49.540 line:93%
- Me? - Yes.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.970 line:93%
I rarely cook.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:51.970 line:93%
(He doesn't do anything.)

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:54.109 line:93%
Pasta suits you.

00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:56.180 line:93%
(This stylish guy looks like he'll only eat pasta.)

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.950 line:93%
Don't worry about the soil on the radish.

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.649 line:93%
I have to rinse it anyway.

00:43:59.649 --> 00:44:00.680 line:93%
(That stylish guy is peeling the radish.)

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.589 line:93%
This peeler works really well.

00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:04.750 line:93%
(He analyzes the peeler.)

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:07.490 line:93%
It works like this. I think it looks okay.

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:08.959 line:93%
You're doing it so neatly.

00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:11.560 line:93%
- I'm trying. - I like how you're doing it.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:15.029 line:93%
(He even peels the parts that won't be eaten.)

00:44:15.899 --> 00:44:17.770 line:93%
Oh, carrot. Please peel the carrot too.

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.069 line:93%
Carrot? One or both?

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.100 line:93%
We just need one carrot.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.339 line:93%
Okay.

00:44:24.709 --> 00:44:28.009 line:93%
Sang Yun, you're really good. It looks so neat.

00:44:28.439 --> 00:44:30.479 line:93%
- I did my best. - Great job.

00:44:30.509 --> 00:44:32.080 line:93%
(Good job)

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.279 line:93%
(I'm starting to get hungry.)

00:44:37.319 --> 00:44:39.350 line:93%
Can somebody bring me some honey powder?

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:41.319 line:93%
- Pardon? Honey powder? - Yes.

00:44:41.319 --> 00:44:42.319 line:93%
(Again?)

00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:44.529 line:93%
I think you've already had 10 spoons of it today.

00:44:44.529 --> 00:44:45.859 line:93%
No, that's not true.

00:44:47.259 --> 00:44:48.660 line:93%
- Is that the small spoon? - Yes.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:49.729 line:93%
(Appetizer is served.)

00:44:49.729 --> 00:44:51.330 line:93%
- Eat it slowly. - All right.

00:44:56.299 --> 00:44:58.669 line:93%
(You never gain weight from things that you enjoy.)

00:44:59.609 --> 00:45:02.080 line:93%
Se Hyeong, what's the most important thing in cooking?

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.410 line:93%
(Sang Yun asks Se Hyeong what's most important in cooking.)

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:06.080 line:93%
- Timing. - Timing?

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.180 line:93%
I look like I'm taking my time and doing things half-heartedly, right?

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.290 line:93%
In fact, everything is calculated in my brain.

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:12.419 line:93%
(Calculate the time)

00:45:12.419 --> 00:45:15.160 line:93%
The steps and the orders.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.359 line:93%
(I'm like Sang Yun when I cook.)

00:45:16.359 --> 00:45:17.660 line:93%
- Like ingredients and... - As you can see,

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.259 line:93%
- I'm making rice and broth first. - Yes.

00:45:20.259 --> 00:45:22.430 line:93%
You should start with things that take a long time.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:23.430 line:93%
(It's all about timing.)

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:24.930 line:93%
(Saved)

00:45:25.529 --> 00:45:28.770 line:93%
Se Hyeong, what can I do to entertain people?

00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:29.939 line:93%
(Sang Yun asks another question.)

00:45:29.939 --> 00:45:30.939 line:93%
You want to entertain people?

00:45:30.939 --> 00:45:33.009 line:93%
Like I told you before,

00:45:33.009 --> 00:45:34.979 line:93%
- you don't really do funny stunts. - Right.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.450 line:93%
You usually make people laugh with your witty remarks.

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:39.950 line:93%
- Right, that's... - I envy that ability so much.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:41.279 line:93%
Sang Yun,

00:45:41.919 --> 00:45:43.220 line:93%
if you want to be like me in that regard...

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.350 line:93%
(If you're dreaming of becoming the next Yang Se Hyeong,)

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:47.490 line:93%
you need to get smacked a lot.

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:48.689 line:93%
(you need to get smacked a lot.)

00:45:48.689 --> 00:45:50.959 line:93%
- I need to get smacked? - Yes. To become...

00:45:50.959 --> 00:45:53.399 line:93%
as tactful and quick-witted as I am now,

00:45:54.029 --> 00:45:55.660 line:93%
I got smacked so much while trying to pull pranks.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:56.870 line:93%
(It's a sure way to become funny.)

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.470 line:93%
I got spanked a lot for being so mischievous.

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:02.200 line:93%
The fact that you're so serious about this conversation is funny.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.669 line:93%
I find it so interesting.

00:46:03.939 --> 00:46:06.069 line:93%
- Do you? - Yes, it's very interesting.

00:46:06.339 --> 00:46:08.209 line:93%
Well, Sang Yun. I think...

00:46:08.209 --> 00:46:10.080 line:93%
you should work on your reactions first.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.850 line:93%
(Even your reactions are problematic.)

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:15.120 line:93%
Or, should I teach you some newly coined words?

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:16.689 line:93%
Yes, I'd love that.

00:46:16.689 --> 00:46:17.990 line:93%
- You want to learn new words? - It'd be great.

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:19.049 line:93%
Do you know this one?

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.120 line:93%
"Odin".

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.759 line:93%
(What could it mean?)

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.959 line:93%
It's probably not the Odin I'm thinking of.

00:46:26.959 --> 00:46:28.060 line:93%
What are you thinking? Odin.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.100 line:93%
(Let's see how quick-witted he is.)

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.299 line:93%
The deity, Odin. It's not that, right?

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.540 line:93%
Gosh, he's seriously not funny.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.839 line:93%
(He's not funny at all.)

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:37.810 line:93%
I just thought of something weird.

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:39.339 line:93%
- What? - It's not the right answer though.

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:41.140 line:93%
An orangutan and...

00:46:43.879 --> 00:46:46.209 line:93%
(Singing)

00:46:46.209 --> 00:46:48.580 line:93%
Ding, ding, ding

00:46:48.649 --> 00:46:52.549 line:93%
(What is in that guy's head?)

00:46:53.819 --> 00:46:55.359 line:93%
- You're very imaginative. - I know, right?

00:46:55.359 --> 00:46:56.520 line:93%
You're very creative.

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.229 line:93%
It's hilarious because it's so shocking.

00:47:00.229 --> 00:47:03.000 line:93%
(Oh, baby)

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:04.930 line:93%
(What shall we eat today?)

00:47:05.029 --> 00:47:07.169 line:93%
(Singing)

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:09.970 line:93%
Do you know how to make rice?

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:12.470 line:93%
That I know. I've done it...

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:15.009 line:93%
when I volunteered at a farm back in college.

00:47:15.009 --> 00:47:16.040 line:93%
You don't need this?

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.379 line:93%
I know how much water should go in.

00:47:17.379 --> 00:47:19.310 line:93%
All right, okay. I'll leave it in your hands, then.

00:47:20.279 --> 00:47:21.319 line:93%
- After that... - You're so dependable.

00:47:21.319 --> 00:47:22.479 line:93%
(He seems very confident.)

00:47:22.479 --> 00:47:24.750 line:93%
This rice cooker is small.

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:26.959 line:93%
(He tries to measure how much water will be needed.)

00:47:26.959 --> 00:47:29.319 line:93%
- Isn't that too much water? - It's a lot, right?

00:47:29.359 --> 00:47:30.459 line:93%
What do you think?

00:47:30.459 --> 00:47:31.689 line:93%
(Flustered)

00:47:31.859 --> 00:47:33.399 line:93%
How much water do you think it needs?

00:47:33.399 --> 00:47:34.600 line:93%
I have a rough idea.

00:47:35.859 --> 00:47:37.370 line:93%
Okay, this will be good.

00:47:38.899 --> 00:47:40.040 line:93%
I think this is good.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.040 line:93%
(Confidently,)

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.069 line:93%
(he puts it on the burner.)

00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:45.640 line:93%
- What are you doing now? - Isn't this what we're doing?

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.879 line:93%
- You want to boil it on that? - Is this not it? Oh, it's there.

00:47:47.879 --> 00:47:49.040 line:93%
Yes, it's over there.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.910 line:93%
Everything will be ready by the time the rice is cooked.

00:47:55.379 --> 00:47:56.520 line:93%
Okay.

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:01.089 line:93%
(Sang Yun, let's please eat breakfast.)

00:48:02.689 --> 00:48:05.229 line:93%
(It looks like he'll finish the whole thing in no time.)

00:48:07.299 --> 00:48:08.330 line:93%
(For their hungry master,)

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:10.169 line:93%
I really love soybean sprouts.

00:48:10.169 --> 00:48:11.529 line:93%
Even just that looks delicious.

00:48:11.529 --> 00:48:13.169 line:93%
(Se Hyeong prepared this special dish for the master.)

00:48:13.169 --> 00:48:15.669 line:93%
(He puts in the broth he made.)

00:48:15.669 --> 00:48:17.839 line:93%
- I see. The broth goes in... - Yes.

00:48:17.839 --> 00:48:19.270 line:93%
after you stir-fry them.

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:20.479 line:93%
Oh, my. It looks delicious.

00:48:20.939 --> 00:48:22.709 line:93%
Then we just have to let it boil.

00:48:22.709 --> 00:48:23.750 line:93%
(For his master with a sensitive stomach,)

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.080 line:93%
(it's soybean sprout soup with pollack.)

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.149 line:93%
Then...

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:28.649 line:93%
It looks so delicious.

00:48:28.649 --> 00:48:29.720 line:93%
(Salivating)

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:33.790 line:93%
Seung Gi, it's ready now. We just need to set the table.

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:36.160 line:93%
(Seung Gi is back after putting away everyone's sleeping bags.)

00:48:38.029 --> 00:48:41.259 line:93%
(He can't take his eyes off the thick rolled omelet.)

00:48:41.259 --> 00:48:42.899 line:93%
This is the most delicious aroma...

00:48:42.899 --> 00:48:44.529 line:93%
I've smelled since arriving at this house.

00:48:44.529 --> 00:48:45.600 line:93%
(It smells good.)

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.040 line:93%
This looks so tasty.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.270 line:93%
- Everything is ready now. - Does it work?

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.109 line:93%
Food is ready. Master can come out now.

00:48:51.669 --> 00:48:53.580 line:93%
Let's eat it just like this. Like what chefs do.

00:48:53.979 --> 00:48:55.009 line:93%
Okay.

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.649 line:93%
That is

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:00.279 line:93%
- Master, food is ready. - Okay, thanks.

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:07.560 line:93%
(You guys made something better than rice crust?)

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.819 line:93%
(I hope master likes the food.)

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:13.399 line:93%
Oh, my. Look at the omelet.

00:49:13.399 --> 00:49:15.629 line:93%
I can't believe I get to eat things like this...

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.569 line:93%
at home.

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:21.270 line:93%
Did Se Hyeong work hard to make all the food?

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:23.439 line:93%
- Yes, he did. - It shows.

00:49:23.439 --> 00:49:25.209 line:93%
I don't pull pranks with food.

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:30.049 line:93%
Oh, my. This is...

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.910 line:93%
My gosh, this is really...

00:49:33.379 --> 00:49:35.220 line:93%
- This is good. - "This is good."

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.549 line:93%
Very good.

00:49:36.649 --> 00:49:39.350 line:93%
Master looks the happiest I've seen today.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:40.790 line:93%
(I'm happy!)

00:49:42.759 --> 00:49:43.759 line:93%
Thanks for the food.

00:49:43.759 --> 00:49:44.930 line:93%
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

00:49:45.529 --> 00:49:48.259 line:93%
Sang Yun did a great job with the rice.

00:49:48.259 --> 00:49:49.700 line:93%
(It's the last meal with master.)

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.299 line:93%
Sang Yun and the rice cooker.

00:49:51.399 --> 00:49:53.399 line:93%
- That's right. Just the water. - It was a collaboration.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.100 line:93%
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:57.109 line:93%
(Se Hyeong is very nervous.)

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.879 line:93%
It's really good.

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:07.549 line:93%
(Satisfied)

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:10.890 line:93%
It's hard to season the soup perfectly.

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:13.390 line:93%
(They haven't had a warm home-cooked meal in a long time.)

00:50:15.259 --> 00:50:16.620 line:93%
(They sit together and share this moment.)

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:17.629 line:93%
You're such a good cook.

00:50:19.459 --> 00:50:23.529 line:93%
(They also share the warmth.)

00:50:24.569 --> 00:50:26.839 line:93%
Being able to cook this well is a sure way to win anyone's love.

00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.540 line:93%
No, it's nothing. They're easy dishes to make.

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:31.939 line:93%
They're easy to make, but I do my very best.

00:50:31.939 --> 00:50:33.479 line:93%
What looks easy is always hard to do.

00:50:33.479 --> 00:50:34.740 line:93%
I never use any flavor enhancers.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.839 line:93%
(Easy things are hard to do.)

00:50:35.839 --> 00:50:39.950 line:93%
(This humble meal is like a feast to the master.)

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.950 line:93%
Eating this warm meal is nice, isn't it?

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:45.319 line:93%
- Yes. - Compared to eating rice crust.

00:50:45.319 --> 00:50:47.720 line:93%
- I'm realizing that now. - After tasting the food?

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.459 line:93%
I didn't know that before I tasted this meal.

00:50:52.129 --> 00:50:53.359 line:93%
- It's so good. - I'm blushing.

00:50:53.359 --> 00:50:54.359 line:93%
(The compliments make me blush.)

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:57.830 line:93%
(The rice I made is good too.)

00:50:59.229 --> 00:51:01.640 line:93%
This is different. You used doenjang, right?

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:02.740 line:93%
The stir-fried fish cakes.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:04.839 line:93%
(Stir-fried fish cakes with doenjang is high in protein.)

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:09.640 line:93%
(What's this familiar taste?)

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.649 line:93%
- This is so good. - I can taste honey powder in it.

00:51:12.649 --> 00:51:13.649 line:93%
(You must've used honey powder.)

00:51:13.649 --> 00:51:15.149 line:93%
(My gosh, I'm impressed.)

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.850 line:93%
(The secret weapon was...)

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:23.120 line:93%
(honey powder indeed.)

00:51:23.629 --> 00:51:24.830 line:93%
- Shall I give it to him now? - No, I want to use it.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:27.729 line:93%
(He used honey powder instead of sugar.)

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:34.140 line:93%
(It's more potent than any flavor enhancer.)

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:38.410 line:93%
(The stir-fried fish cake dish was catered to the master's palate.)

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.680 line:93%
I think it's so tasty because of doenjang.

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.750 line:93%
Putting in doenjang was such a good idea.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:46.850 line:93%
(Yes, this tastes perfect.)

00:51:49.319 --> 00:51:52.490 line:93%
(It melts in my mouth.)

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.830 line:93%
(The fish cakes taste like honey.)

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.229 line:93%
- Hey, is there more of this? - Yes, we have more.

00:52:02.229 --> 00:52:03.899 line:93%
Se Hyeong, this. Master wants more.

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.000 line:93%
Hey, we should just throw out his rice crust.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.040 line:93%
(Master is now addicted to the sweet and salty flavors.)

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.540 line:93%
We shouldn't have made the rice crust.

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.540 line:93%
(Why did we even make it yesterday?)

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:14.939 line:93%
The combination of doenjang and honey powder is delicious.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:17.549 line:93%
For some reason, the second serving tastes even better.

00:52:18.209 --> 00:52:19.209 line:93%
(Exclaiming excitedly)

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:21.750 line:93%
(We're excited too.)

00:52:22.779 --> 00:52:24.890 line:93%
By the way, this is really tasty.

00:52:26.049 --> 00:52:27.060 line:93%
Doenjang...

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:28.259 line:93%
(Master said...)

00:52:28.259 --> 00:52:29.890 line:93%
(the worst thing that can happen...)

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:31.390 line:93%
(when he performs...)

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:33.089 line:93%
(is getting an upset stomach.)

00:52:33.089 --> 00:52:36.770 line:93%
(He said that's why he only eats rice crust.)

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:39.899 line:93%
(He might actually get a stomachache because he's inhaling the food now.)

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.339 line:93%
Don't you guys...

00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:45.740 line:93%
get nervous before you perform?

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.310 line:93%
I do get nervous. Just like you, I can't really eat before I perform.

00:52:48.839 --> 00:52:51.350 line:93%
- Is that right? - I'm nervous the whole time.

00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:53.850 line:93%
- It must be nerve-racking. - Yes, I get very nervous.

00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:57.120 line:93%
Sometimes, I wonder if I should just...

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:59.319 line:93%
pass out after singing two songs.

00:53:01.189 --> 00:53:02.890 line:93%
- Pardon? - I wonder if I should say...

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:05.490 line:93%
that I can't do it anymore and just pass out.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:07.529 line:93%
You've never actually done it, right?

00:53:07.529 --> 00:53:09.259 line:93%
No, I haven't. But I almost did.

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:11.370 line:93%
- Were you that nervous? - Of course.

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:15.799 line:93%
Is there anything you're insecure about in terms of your singing?

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.370 line:93%
- I'm curious. - My insecurities?

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:18.509 line:93%
(Do they have any insecurities?)

00:53:18.509 --> 00:53:20.910 line:93%
- What about you? - In my case,

00:53:22.439 --> 00:53:25.080 line:93%
I became a singer almost seven years ago.

00:53:25.149 --> 00:53:28.319 line:93%
Since I debuted at a young age, my voice has changed a lot.

00:53:28.319 --> 00:53:29.319 line:93%
But...

00:53:29.319 --> 00:53:30.419 line:93%
(He has changed a lot.)

00:53:30.419 --> 00:53:34.589 line:93%
Will those who liked my voice seven years ago,

00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:36.660 line:93%
those who liked it a year ago,

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.790 line:93%
and those who liked it two years ago...

00:53:39.029 --> 00:53:43.370 line:93%
like me as I am now and continue to stay as my fan in the future...

00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:47.100 line:93%
despite all the changes to come? That's my biggest concern now.

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.100 line:93%
(Will they like the changes?)

00:53:48.799 --> 00:53:50.339 line:93%
You see, about that...

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:53.270 line:93%
Everyone gets their turn, their time to shine.

00:53:53.439 --> 00:53:56.640 line:93%
Wanting to have everything will only tire you out.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.209 line:93%
(Wanting everything will only exhaust you.)

00:53:58.209 --> 00:54:01.120 line:93%
If you do your best at whatever it is that you're doing,

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.120 line:93%
your turn will definitely come.

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.319 line:93%
And when it comes, it'll happen in such a magical way.

00:54:06.759 --> 00:54:08.520 line:93%
- That is so true. - Just keep what you're doing...

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:09.919 line:93%
because your magic will happen.

00:54:09.919 --> 00:54:13.660 line:93%
I'm so... I totally agree with it. It's really resonating with me.

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:14.660 line:93%
(Follow your beliefs,)

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:19.830 line:93%
(and your turn will definitely come.)

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.270 line:93%
Master, I think your band members are here.

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:25.370 line:93%
- Really? - Yes.

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:26.939 line:93%
(The last chance to communicate with the master)

00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:29.140 line:93%
- Hello. - Hello.

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.149 line:93%
Hello.

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:31.850 line:93%
Hello.

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:35.250 line:93%
I'll get this out of the way. No, please don't worry.

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:39.950 line:93%
(The master also heads to the practice room with his guitar.)

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:45.359 line:93%
(After putting all the blankets away,)

00:54:45.359 --> 00:54:47.500 line:93%
(the practice room finally looks like how it always does.)

00:54:49.029 --> 00:54:51.299 line:93%
(In this space where In Kwon's songs were created,)

00:54:51.299 --> 00:54:54.770 line:93%
(they'll communicate with him on an emotional level for one last time.)

00:54:57.370 --> 00:55:02.439 line:93%
(Jeon In Kwon Band: Min Jae Hyun, Shin Yun Cheol, Shin Sung Min)

00:55:04.609 --> 00:55:06.580 line:93%
- Gosh, I'm excited for this. - Hello.

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:08.379 line:93%
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

00:55:08.379 --> 00:55:09.879 line:93%
(The vibe has totally changed.)

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:12.149 line:93%
- Hello. - It's too small, you know.

00:55:12.149 --> 00:55:13.759 line:93%
(They're familiar with this room, but it feels different.)

00:55:13.759 --> 00:55:15.560 line:93%
This room can transform like this.

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.620 line:93%
- I know, right? - Of course.

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:17.759 line:93%
We get to watch them practice.

00:55:17.759 --> 00:55:18.890 line:93%
(They're honored.)

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:20.629 line:93%
- We're so honored. - Seriously.

00:55:20.629 --> 00:55:22.029 line:93%
- I'm flattered. - My seat is amazing.

00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:24.930 line:93%
How much would I have to pay if this seat was for sale?

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:27.000 line:93%
- It's on the bed too. - Exactly, it's on the bed.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.370 line:93%
- It's a premium seat. - A super-premium seat.

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:30.609 line:93%
I got a super-premium seat.

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:35.009 line:93%
- Oh, my. I'm truly honored. - You know me, right?

00:55:35.009 --> 00:55:37.479 line:93%
(One person wanted to meet In Kwon more than others did.)

00:55:37.479 --> 00:55:39.149 line:93%
(Seong Jae picked him...)

00:55:39.149 --> 00:55:43.120 line:93%
(as the number one master he had wanted to meet.)

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:48.060 line:93%
(He couldn't really express his excitement because he's shy,)

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:51.459 line:93%
(but he was so excited to meet In Kwon in person,)

00:55:51.459 --> 00:55:54.629 line:93%
(and he's been waiting for this very moment.)

00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.669 line:93%
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:02.439 line:93%
(The clumsy, goofy In Kwon is gone.)

00:56:02.439 --> 00:56:05.569 line:93%
(Music completely transforms the master.)

00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:07.209 line:93%
Oh, is this it?

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:08.939 line:93%
He looks like a different person.

00:56:08.939 --> 00:56:10.310 line:93%
(Did I look cool?)

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:12.279 line:93%
Master. If you don't mind,

00:56:12.279 --> 00:56:15.379 line:93%
- may I make a request? - Okay.

00:56:15.479 --> 00:56:17.049 line:93%
I'd love to hear you sing "After Love".

00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:20.089 line:93%
- It's my personal favorite. - Can we do it without the keyboard?

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.620 line:93%
Even if it's just a snippet.

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.120 line:93%
- Okay. - Just the first verse.

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:25.790 line:93%
(Shall we begin?)

00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:27.160 line:93%
All right, let's do this.

00:56:28.299 --> 00:56:29.399 line:93%
Let's go.

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:42.240 line:93%
(This 16m² space...)

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:46.649 line:93%
(is where he has spent his life in the last 63 years.)

00:56:46.919 --> 00:56:51.490 line:93%
(They quietly focus on the master's voice...)

00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:55.060 line:93%
(in the very space where his music was born.)

00:57:14.009 --> 00:57:16.509 line:93%
(The members gradually...)

00:57:16.509 --> 00:57:19.750 line:93%
(become immersed in his voice.)

00:57:31.089 --> 00:57:35.629 line:93%
(Why am I)

00:57:35.629 --> 00:57:40.000 line:93%
(Standing here?)

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.640 line:93%
(Tonight)

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:49.040 line:93%
(Countless stars)

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:56.250 line:93%
(And memories)

00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:58.950 line:93%
(Appear before my eyes)

00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:06.729 line:93%
(And dance again)

00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:26.750 line:93%
This needs...

00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:27.950 line:93%
I can't sing it without the keyboard.

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:29.450 line:93%
- No, that's not true at all. - It was still so good.

00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:31.589 line:93%
- Oh, my. - I'm so honored.

00:58:31.819 --> 00:58:34.220 line:93%
Gosh, I could hear...

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:35.620 line:93%
- my own mistakes. - Gosh, not at all.

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.729 line:93%
I've completely erased the sight of you eating rice crust.

00:58:37.729 --> 00:58:39.589 line:93%
- Really? - You were so cool.

00:58:39.729 --> 00:58:41.029 line:93%
- Later... - It was really incredible.

00:58:41.029 --> 00:58:44.729 line:93%
I kept playing this djembe for you. Did I do a good job?

00:58:44.729 --> 00:58:46.629 line:93%
It did get on my nerves a little, but it wasn't bad.

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:50.470 line:93%
- I'll do my best. - You did an improvisation.

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:51.669 line:93%
- That was so... - You know how I am.

00:58:51.939 --> 00:58:55.180 line:93%
His presence becomes even bigger when he sings.

00:58:55.439 --> 00:58:57.209 line:93%
- Right. - I've spent two days with him,

00:58:57.209 --> 00:58:58.750 line:93%
and his presence is even bigger now.

00:58:58.750 --> 00:58:59.879 line:93%
Thank you.

00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.120 line:93%
"Thank you."

00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:05.120 line:93%
(He's cute.)

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.859 line:93%
Gosh, I want to keep requesting songs that I want to hear.

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.890 line:93%
- There's a song I want to request. - Seriously.

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.930 line:93%
I'd love to hear "Please".

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:12.930 line:93%
(Sang Yun requests a song.)

00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:15.060 line:93%
- Can we do "Please" now? - "Please".

00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.069 line:93%
- Yes. - Let's give it shot, then.

00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:18.529 line:93%
Gosh, I get to hear this song.

00:59:18.899 --> 00:59:22.669 line:93%
(The question Sang Yun has been asking himself these days)

00:59:22.669 --> 00:59:26.109 line:93%
(His limits)

00:59:26.509 --> 00:59:29.740 line:93%
(I think that I've given my best,)

00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:32.379 line:93%
(but other people think differently.)

00:59:32.379 --> 00:59:35.220 line:93%
(Am I at my limits?)

00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.419 line:93%
(Or do people expect too much from me?)

00:59:37.419 --> 00:59:39.450 line:93%
- Okay. Let's try "Please". - All right.

00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:40.490 line:93%
(Sang Yun requested "Please".)

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.919 line:93%
I'll give you guys a cue.

00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:47.700 line:93%
You guys know it roughly, right?

00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.270 line:93%
Three.

01:00:00.209 --> 01:00:05.049 line:93%
(Please stop)

01:00:05.049 --> 01:00:09.419 line:93%
(I'm not your puppet)

01:00:09.419 --> 01:00:12.790 line:93%
(I'm not your puppet)

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:19.490 line:93%
(You know it too)

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:24.500 line:93%
(Think about it again)

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.100 line:93%
(Look up)

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:32.109 line:93%
(And look at my face again)

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:38.850 line:93%
(I'm lonely)

01:00:39.310 --> 01:00:43.450 line:93%
(I can't be the perfect man)

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:48.120 line:93%
(You want me to be)

01:00:48.419 --> 01:00:53.060 line:93%
(I'm just)

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:56.830 line:93%
(A lonely person)

01:00:56.830 --> 01:00:58.899 line:93%
(Please)

01:00:59.129 --> 01:01:03.040 line:93%

(Please, I'm thirsty)

01:01:12.609 --> 01:01:14.819 line:93%
(Open up your heart)

01:01:14.819 --> 01:01:21.660 line:93%
(And love me)

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:26.430 line:93%
(Please stop)

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:29.529 line:93%
(The bird inside the cage)

01:01:29.529 --> 01:01:33.370 line:93%
(Is beyond exhausted)

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:39.370 line:93%
(You know it too)

01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:43.910 line:93%

(I can't be the perfect man)

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:05.629 line:93%

(Suddenly, the countless moments...)

01:02:54.020 --> 01:03:00.160 line:93%
(they said "please" to themselves cross their minds.)

(Master In Kwon sang his song, "Please",)

01:04:00.149 --> 01:04:03.950 line:93%
(as if he's giving solace to the members.)

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:15.729 line:93%
- That was incredible. - Master.

01:04:15.759 --> 01:04:17.470 line:93%
- Master. - Master.

01:04:17.899 --> 01:04:20.600 line:93%
- That was phenomenal. - All the Butlers.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.740 line:93%
Go, All the Butlers.

01:04:22.799 --> 01:04:24.740 line:93%
That was really... Gosh, I don't even know what to say.

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.009 line:93%
Seong Jae, did you cry?

01:04:26.209 --> 01:04:27.439 line:93%
- Yes, I did. - He cried.

01:04:27.609 --> 01:04:29.140 line:93%
- Seriously? My gosh. - Yes.

01:04:29.939 --> 01:04:32.180 line:93%
Gosh, I'm grateful that it resonated with you.

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:34.279 line:93%
I cried because I was so touched and honored.

01:04:35.149 --> 01:04:37.490 line:93%
As soon as he started singing,

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:40.419 line:93%
I thought, "How many times did he have to sing it..."

01:04:41.919 --> 01:04:44.859 line:93%
- The way it made you feel. - "to sound like that?"

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:48.529 line:93%
Every "please" he uttered was different.

01:04:48.899 --> 01:04:52.729 line:93%
It made me wonder how much effort he must've had to make...

01:04:52.729 --> 01:04:56.600 line:93%
to be able to sing like that, and that thought...

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.740 line:93%
Yes, that is true.

01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:00.410 line:93%
I have made a lot of effort.

01:05:01.979 --> 01:05:04.250 line:93%
Most people would deny it just to sound modest,

01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:06.379 line:93%
but he proudly admitted that he has made a lot of effort.

01:05:08.979 --> 01:05:10.689 line:93%
It was very hard.

01:05:13.189 --> 01:05:16.589 line:93%
In the last two days that we've spent with the master,

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.259 line:93%
we saw how he practices every day...

01:05:19.259 --> 01:05:22.899 line:93%
and how this song came into being.

01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:25.370 line:93%
I think that's why it was more touching.

01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:29.100 line:93%
It was... It was really like watching a film.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:33.939 line:93%
Sang Yun, why did you tear up suddenly?

01:05:34.979 --> 01:05:36.540 line:93%
- I didn't know it was this sad. - I just...

01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:39.810 line:93%
I felt as if he was saying those words to me.

01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:43.080 line:93%
(I felt as if he was talking to me.)

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.520 line:93%
It's just that... I could really feel his sentiments.

01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:48.390 line:93%
He sang with his sincere feelings.

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:53.089 line:93%
- For some reason, it was so... - Gosh, what is wrong with me?

01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:57.870 line:93%
(To everyone who's been feeling like they've reached their limit)

01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:02.040 line:93%
(It was Master In Kwon's message of consolation.)

01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:06.680 line:93%
(You don't have to be perfect.)

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:12.609 line:93%
It was so... It's too hard to summarize it in one sentence.

01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:15.819 line:93%
It'll probably end up being at least 30 sentences.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.950 line:93%
(They think about what they learned from their time with the master.)

01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:20.089 line:93%
What is wrong with me?

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:22.560 line:93%
No more!

01:06:23.629 --> 01:06:24.859 line:93%
I must be going crazy.

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:26.330 line:93%
I really need to stop crying now.

01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:35.169 line:93%
If I were to describe my experience with In Kwon's life in two words,

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:39.109 line:93%
I'd say that I was inspired and touched.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.479 line:93%
I really mean this.

01:06:42.479 --> 01:06:44.109 line:93%
(What Se Hyeong learned)

01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:47.649 line:93%
He taught me such a valuable lesson. I mean it most sincerely.

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:52.549 line:93%
I can be eccentric.

01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:55.319 line:93%
That's what makes me real.

01:06:55.319 --> 01:06:56.990 line:93%
(I can be eccentric. That's what makes me real.)

01:06:56.990 --> 01:07:00.059 line:93%
Since getting into this profession at a young age,

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:03.969 line:93%
many people have told me that I'm eccentric and quirky.

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:07.740 line:93%
Those words did hurt my feelings from time to time.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.639 line:93%
I thought that people were trying to make fun of me.

01:07:10.939 --> 01:07:12.439 line:93%
But observing the master...

01:07:12.439 --> 01:07:16.240 line:93%
has taught me that I shouldn't care about what others think of me...

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.750 line:93%
if I'm being my honest self,

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:22.279 line:93%
and I think I can now forgive others for calling me eccentric or weird.

01:07:23.389 --> 01:07:25.349 line:93%
- I really mean it. - That's very inspiring.

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:28.620 line:93%
I shouldn't doubt the path I'm on.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:31.290 line:93%
(That's Seong Jae's one sentence.)

01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:33.899 line:93%
He told us that everyone gets their turn eventually...

01:07:33.899 --> 01:07:36.359 line:93%
if they keep walking forward on their path.

01:07:36.729 --> 01:07:38.700 line:93%
- That really resonated with me. - Yes, totally.

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.670 line:93%
I think it'll help me a lot in my future endeavors.

01:07:42.439 --> 01:07:46.439 line:93%
Master probably doesn't think that he unilaterally taught us...

01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:49.580 line:93%
what he has felt and learned in his life.

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:52.910 line:93%
All he did was tell us about his experiences...

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:57.819 line:93%
and things that he has felt from his point of view.

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.189 line:93%
There's a part like this in the lyrics I wrote.

01:08:00.359 --> 01:08:02.819 line:93%
"My agony is solely mine."

01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:07.899 line:93%
"All of it exists for my new beginning."

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.469 line:93%
- It goes like that. - "My agony is solely mine."

01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:13.969 line:93%
It means, "My agony is mine, so don't touch it."

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.309 line:93%
"All of it exists for my new beginning."

01:08:17.469 --> 01:08:19.710 line:93%
That's how I've actually lived my life.

01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:24.080 line:93%
(My agony is mine, and it exists for my new beginning.)

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:28.519 line:93%
I came up with a sentence that sums up everyone's experiences.

01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:31.490 line:93%
"The night with Master In Kwon was..."

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:33.760 line:93%
"as heart-touching as the rice crust soup."

01:08:34.889 --> 01:08:37.960 line:93%
You guys know what I mean, right? That's how we touched we are.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.929 line:93%
- Isn't it a good way to put it? - Yes, it's great.

01:08:39.929 --> 01:08:41.529 line:93%
- I think it's very witty. - It sure is.

01:08:41.529 --> 01:08:43.260 line:93%
(Seung Gi wraps it up with his witty remark.)

01:08:43.469 --> 01:08:45.569 line:93%
Could we visit you again later on?

01:08:45.569 --> 01:08:47.569 line:93%
Of course, anytime.

01:08:47.569 --> 01:08:50.439 line:93%
You guys are welcome anytime. You can sleep beside me too.

01:08:51.609 --> 01:08:53.410 line:93%
- I mean it. - Okay.

01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:55.710 line:93%
If you can promise us that you won't sleep in...

01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:58.580 line:93%
Please promise us that you'll wake up on time.

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:00.319 line:93%
(What kind of exciting encounter is awaiting them next week?)

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:01.880 line:93%
Hurry up. Run.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.019 line:93%
(Running away is useless.)

01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:05.319 line:93%
(Master is everywhere.)

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:07.590 line:93%
- Master, we love you. - Master, we love you.

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:09.620 line:93%
(Do it properly, will you?)

01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:12.490 line:93%
(Even if they're going crazy...)

01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:14.200 line:93%
(or want to go home,)

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.929 line:93%
(they have no choice.)

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:19.200 line:93%
(The master trains them...)

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.139 line:93%
(inside the mountains where there's no escape.)

01:09:24.809 --> 01:09:26.109 line:93%
(Are you crying again?)

01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:27.479 line:93%
(Who's the master...)

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:29.340 line:93%
(that has the members under his thumb?)

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:34.920 line:93%
Hurry up!

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.790 line:93%
You come down here, Master!

01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:39.120 line:93%
I'm sorry!

01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:43.120 line:93%
(All the Butlers, The Intense Training)
