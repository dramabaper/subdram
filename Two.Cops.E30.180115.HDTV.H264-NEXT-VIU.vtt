00:00:06.983 --> 00:00:08.182 line:93%
(Episode 30)

00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:11.784 line:93%
Tak Jung Hwan. What a scary man.

00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:13.624 line:93%
Why are you all sitting around?

00:00:13.624 --> 00:00:15.694 line:93%
Go arrest that jerk.

00:00:15.694 --> 00:00:19.424 line:93%
But whom did he kill? That's not clear here.

00:00:19.523 --> 00:00:22.133 line:93%
You're right. If he denies it, it'll be over.

00:00:23.293 --> 00:00:25.163 line:93%
Goodness, is there no way around this?

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:30.974 line:93%
Tak has no idea...

00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:34.514 line:93%
that this lighter is damaged or that we have it.

00:00:35.743 --> 00:00:36.843 line:93%
You're right.

00:00:41.254 --> 00:00:44.523 line:93%
If Director Tak is looking for this lighter,

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:47.554 line:93%
I'm sure Jin is also looking for this.

00:00:48.224 --> 00:00:50.423 line:93%
Jin is the most important suspect for us right now.

00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:53.194 line:93%
If we arrest her, we can also get to Director Tak.

00:00:53.463 --> 00:00:57.033 line:93%
Yes, but she's gone completely off the radar.

00:00:58.603 --> 00:00:59.834 line:93%
Jin Soo A.

00:01:00.663 --> 00:01:02.574 line:93%
If you want her to come out,

00:01:02.574 --> 00:01:05.543 line:93%
we just have to show her where this lighter is.

00:01:06.403 --> 00:01:08.344 line:93%
And how are we going to do that?

00:01:22.224 --> 00:01:24.864 line:93%
I need to use the restroom.

00:01:29.094 --> 00:01:30.834 line:93%
- Let's take a five. - Okay.

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:33.963 line:93%
What?

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:37.743 line:93%
My gosh. I'm such a genius.

00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:43.013 line:93%
I just came up with a fantastic idea.

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:46.144 line:93%
I'm too smart to live as a conman.

00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:48.383 line:93%
Let's think more about your body than your brains for now.

00:01:48.853 --> 00:01:50.454 line:93%
So what's your idea?

00:01:51.254 --> 00:01:52.323 line:93%
So...

00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:54.194 line:93%
do you want to hear it?

00:01:54.454 --> 00:01:56.123 line:93%
So this is my opinion.

00:01:56.394 --> 00:02:00.394 line:93%
Who should have the lighter for it to be threatening to Tak?

00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:02.493 line:93%
Someone who knows Director Tak very well.

00:02:02.594 --> 00:02:04.903 line:93%
We need someone who knows all of his weaknesses.

00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:08.334 line:93%
Is there someone who'll give us that information?

00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:10.634 line:93%
There is...

00:02:11.343 --> 00:02:12.473 line:93%
one guy.

00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:14.544 line:93%
Okay. I think I know.

00:02:14.644 --> 00:02:16.174 line:93%
Then who'll be the player?

00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:17.783 line:93%
Dong Tak?

00:02:22.253 --> 00:02:24.253 line:93%
There's another guy who's apparently better. I mean, he's better.

00:02:29.894 --> 00:02:31.824 line:93%
You got fired, and I got fired.

00:02:32.123 --> 00:02:34.894 line:93%
It's not fair how we were the only ones who took a toll.

00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:38.033 line:93%
That's why I told you to shut it and keep silent.

00:02:44.134 --> 00:02:45.674 line:93%
Exactly.

00:02:46.544 --> 00:02:49.943 line:93%
I heard you're rather close with Director Tak.

00:02:50.743 --> 00:02:52.813 line:93%
Can't he do anything for you?

00:02:52.813 --> 00:02:54.584 line:93%
Don't even bring up his name.

00:02:55.084 --> 00:02:56.454 line:93%
Once I get out of here,

00:02:56.914 --> 00:02:58.924 line:93%
I'm going to join forces with Chairman Jo and...

00:03:00.084 --> 00:03:01.123 line:93%
Chairman Jo?

00:03:02.023 --> 00:03:04.693 line:93%
Chairman Jo is incredibly agitated right now.

00:03:05.593 --> 00:03:08.864 line:93%
Director Tak betrayed him big time.

00:03:08.864 --> 00:03:10.394 line:93%
Chairman Jo Man Ho of Star Group.

00:03:10.394 --> 00:03:14.674 line:93%
He's probably dying to give Tak a blow.

00:03:15.604 --> 00:03:16.834 line:93%
So what?

00:03:17.503 --> 00:03:19.574 line:93%
Do you want to deceive Chairman Jo into this?

00:03:22.343 --> 00:03:24.243 line:93%
There's a really good player when it comes to fraud.

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:30.614 line:93%
Who?

00:03:37.824 --> 00:03:38.824 line:93%
Captain Yoo.

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:40.693 line:93%
You were looking for a player, right?

00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:48.273 line:93%
You're insane.

00:03:50.403 --> 00:03:51.473 line:93%
Okay.

00:03:53.104 --> 00:03:54.104 line:93%
So...

00:03:54.873 --> 00:03:58.443 line:93%
why does the detective who took away my son want to see me?

00:04:00.544 --> 00:04:02.984 line:93%
Director Jo and I had a minor misunderstanding.

00:04:03.253 --> 00:04:04.954 line:93%
I came to fix that.

00:04:05.884 --> 00:04:08.623 line:93%
What's your card? Let's hear it.

00:04:17.433 --> 00:04:18.464 line:93%
A lighter?

00:04:18.604 --> 00:04:21.304 line:93%
There's something very scary in here.

00:04:23.674 --> 00:04:25.604 line:93%
Tak Jung Hwan.

00:04:45.224 --> 00:04:47.893 line:93%
So you want more? If I give you the money,

00:04:48.034 --> 00:04:49.864 line:93%
you won't tell anyone about...

00:04:50.063 --> 00:04:51.503 line:93%
killing...

00:04:52.534 --> 00:04:54.034 line:93%
I'll call you in three days.

00:04:54.034 --> 00:04:55.104 line:93%
This is...

00:04:55.104 --> 00:04:56.433 line:93%
In three days...

00:04:57.034 --> 00:05:01.073 line:93%
I told you that you'd love it.

00:05:04.714 --> 00:05:06.943 line:93%
And why did you bring this to me?

00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:08.583 line:93%
If I can make a business card...

00:05:10.214 --> 00:05:11.453 line:93%
No, forget that.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.154 line:93%
What happened to...

00:05:14.924 --> 00:05:18.063 line:93%
Director Tak 16 years ago?

00:05:19.224 --> 00:05:20.864 line:93%
That's all I need to know.

00:05:23.263 --> 00:05:26.563 line:93%
Why do you want to know that, Detective Cha?

00:05:31.404 --> 00:05:33.344 line:93%
He betrayed me big time.

00:05:33.743 --> 00:05:36.274 line:93%
So I want to give him...

00:05:36.513 --> 00:05:38.443 line:93%
a huge blow too.

00:05:39.614 --> 00:05:43.183 line:93%
You and I have something in common. A huge blow.

00:05:45.183 --> 00:05:47.654 line:93%
You're very cute.

00:05:49.054 --> 00:05:51.123 line:93%
Thank you, sir.

00:06:02.034 --> 00:06:04.904 line:93%
Money laundering, embezzlement, accounting fraud.

00:06:05.404 --> 00:06:08.513 line:93%
But you did something far more interesting that these.

00:06:08.513 --> 00:06:09.914 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:06:09.914 --> 00:06:14.083 line:93%
I recently received a very interesting toy.

00:06:15.154 --> 00:06:18.823 line:93%
It's really interesting. This lighter can talk.

00:06:21.323 --> 00:06:22.693 line:93%
How did you...

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.823 line:93%
You shouldn't be wondering how I got this.

00:06:26.024 --> 00:06:27.464 line:93%
Shouldn't you be...

00:06:27.893 --> 00:06:30.333 line:93%
more curious about...

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:32.864 line:93%
how I will use this?

00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:35.133 line:93%
What do you want?

00:06:35.133 --> 00:06:36.674 line:93%
Money is above the law.

00:06:37.774 --> 00:06:39.774 line:93%
And I want something above money.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:42.243 line:93%
So you want me to overturn your son's trial.

00:06:42.344 --> 00:06:46.544 line:93%
And lie face down below my feet, and bark like a dog.

00:06:46.883 --> 00:06:49.714 line:93%
You're just a director in prosecution.

00:06:49.714 --> 00:06:51.583 line:93%
How dare you betray me?

00:06:52.424 --> 00:06:53.854 line:93%
How arrogant of you.

00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:58.224 line:93%
At least, I don't kill people.

00:07:12.243 --> 00:07:14.573 line:93%
That lighter we've been looking for...

00:07:15.373 --> 00:07:17.114 line:93%
is in a stranger's hands.

00:07:18.143 --> 00:07:20.854 line:93%
People's habits do not change very often.

00:07:21.714 --> 00:07:23.054 line:93%
Chairman Jo...

00:07:24.524 --> 00:07:26.484 line:93%
always stores important articles...

00:07:28.224 --> 00:07:30.323 line:93%
in his office desk instead of his safe.

00:07:33.024 --> 00:07:34.294 line:93%
May I ask you...

00:07:35.464 --> 00:07:37.164 line:93%
for one last favor?

00:08:29.984 --> 00:08:31.224 line:93%
- What's that? - What is that?

00:08:31.424 --> 00:08:33.223 line:93%
- Over there. - Control room, what's going on?

00:08:33.823 --> 00:08:35.054 line:93%
Control room.

00:09:15.693 --> 00:09:18.504 line:93%
The stabber that twists went in there?

00:09:19.034 --> 00:09:20.233 line:93%
How?

00:09:20.874 --> 00:09:22.433 line:93%
The chairman and I had a deal.

00:09:24.774 --> 00:09:28.044 line:93%
Someone will sneak in tonight.

00:09:28.914 --> 00:09:30.514 line:93%
Let the person in.

00:09:30.514 --> 00:09:33.213 line:93%
- You persuaded a chairman? - Yes.

00:09:33.983 --> 00:09:35.683 line:93%
Shall we get her when she comes out?

00:09:35.683 --> 00:09:36.884 line:93%
No.

00:09:37.353 --> 00:09:40.784 line:93%
We'll get them when the person meets her handler.

00:09:40.784 --> 00:09:43.424 line:93%
2 birds with 1 stone?

00:09:57.333 --> 00:09:58.573 line:93%
What's that?

00:09:59.274 --> 00:10:01.674 line:93%
The one the twisting stabber has...

00:10:02.044 --> 00:10:03.374 line:93%
is a tracking device.

00:10:04.384 --> 00:10:08.213 line:93%
Is this the one and only tracker in the world you said you had?

00:10:08.213 --> 00:10:09.784 line:93%
What? Which...

00:10:10.154 --> 00:10:13.384 line:93%
Oh, that one's inside me...

00:10:15.124 --> 00:10:16.494 line:93%
What nonsense is that?

00:10:16.853 --> 00:10:20.193 line:93%
Hey, I want one of those. Where'd you get it? Is it expensive?

00:10:24.264 --> 00:10:27.233 line:93%
That's her. Now, come at me.

00:10:27.534 --> 00:10:29.874 line:93%
- What? - Like last time.

00:10:29.874 --> 00:10:31.644 line:93%
Hard, in one go, okay?

00:10:31.644 --> 00:10:33.744 line:93%
You want me to punch you again?

00:10:34.244 --> 00:10:36.443 line:93%
Have you gone wrong in the head?

00:10:37.884 --> 00:10:39.183 line:93%
I like it.

00:10:49.424 --> 00:10:50.624 line:93%
Well done.

00:10:52.424 --> 00:10:54.933 line:93%
- Are you okay? - I'm fine, I...

00:10:55.933 --> 00:10:57.534 line:93%
Why do I feel so weak this time?

00:10:57.534 --> 00:10:59.634 line:93%
Leave it to me. Go to the hospital.

00:11:02.233 --> 00:11:03.733 line:93%
You too.

00:11:03.973 --> 00:11:05.374 line:93%
Call me regularly.

00:11:07.103 --> 00:11:09.073 line:93%
Whom were you talking to?

00:11:09.144 --> 00:11:10.274 line:93%
(Genesis Connected Service)

00:11:18.683 --> 00:11:20.323 line:93%
(Sending command...)

00:11:20.323 --> 00:11:21.353 line:93%
(Sent)

00:11:21.554 --> 00:11:23.754 line:93%
(System on)

00:11:38.703 --> 00:11:42.174 line:93%
- Let's go. - Why did he bring me for?

00:11:42.374 --> 00:11:44.343 line:93%
Whom was he talking to?

00:11:44.343 --> 00:11:46.713 line:93%
To me. Can we go? I'm exhausted.

00:12:02.164 --> 00:12:03.294 line:93%
Okay.

00:12:03.463 --> 00:12:05.733 line:93%
So this is it.

00:12:07.063 --> 00:12:10.004 line:93%
Violent Crimes 2, it's time to get moving.

00:12:10.004 --> 00:12:11.904 line:93%
Okay, let's do this.

00:12:16.343 --> 00:12:18.083 line:93%
(Slow)

00:13:12.404 --> 00:13:13.933 line:93%
The motorcyclist...

00:13:13.933 --> 00:13:17.333 line:93%
fits the description of a murder suspect we're after.

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:20.914 line:93%
You wouldn't have any business with such a person,

00:13:21.573 --> 00:13:24.113 line:93%
but could you come with us for a chat?

00:13:24.884 --> 00:13:26.014 line:93%
Of course.

00:13:26.983 --> 00:13:27.983 line:93%
Thank you.

00:13:30.254 --> 00:13:31.323 line:93%
What?

00:13:32.284 --> 00:13:36.654 line:93%
Sir, your father agreed to come to the police station.

00:13:36.754 --> 00:13:38.563 line:93%
- He did? - Yes.

00:14:12.323 --> 00:14:13.764 line:93%
Where's Jin Soo A?

00:14:15.433 --> 00:14:16.693 line:93%
I lost her,

00:14:18.433 --> 00:14:20.103 line:93%
but I know where she'll go.

00:14:49.363 --> 00:14:51.264 line:93%
I was almost too late.

00:14:51.264 --> 00:14:52.833 line:93%
She might show up.

00:14:53.404 --> 00:14:54.833 line:93%
Whatever happens,

00:14:55.504 --> 00:14:57.874 line:93%
- protect Gong Soo Chang. - Don't worry.

00:14:57.874 --> 00:14:59.843 line:93%
If I see that twisting stabber,

00:14:59.843 --> 00:15:01.073 line:93%
I'll kill her.

00:15:01.073 --> 00:15:05.083 line:93%
Are you the twisting stabber from Japan?

00:15:05.544 --> 00:15:07.284 line:93%
So you're female.

00:15:07.284 --> 00:15:08.613 line:93%
Nice to meet you.

00:15:09.313 --> 00:15:13.683 line:93%
See, I'm pretty good with a blade myself.

00:15:13.683 --> 00:15:16.723 line:93%
Come at me. Seeing you're female,

00:15:16.723 --> 00:15:18.823 line:93%
I won't try too hard.

00:15:24.063 --> 00:15:26.833 line:93%
Darn it. Get up! Quick!

00:15:26.833 --> 00:15:29.634 line:93%
Go after her! She can't get away!

00:15:29.634 --> 00:15:31.644 line:93%
What are we doing this for?

00:15:31.644 --> 00:15:34.843 line:93%
Soo Chang, stay strong. Do it for your cellmate.

00:15:35.144 --> 00:15:38.144 line:93%
You're cellmates? You were in prison?

00:15:52.563 --> 00:15:54.764 line:93%
We have some talking to do.

00:16:00.634 --> 00:16:02.573 line:93%
You killed Hang Joon.

00:16:09.813 --> 00:16:11.744 line:93%
He was family to me.

00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:46.768 line:93%

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

00:17:20.643 --> 00:17:22.083 line:93%
Jin Soo A!

00:17:28.123 --> 00:17:30.024 line:93%
You have the right to remain silent.

00:17:30.923 --> 00:17:33.264 line:93%
You can hire a lawyer...

00:17:33.264 --> 00:17:35.133 line:93%
and refuse to make incriminating statements.

00:17:38.504 --> 00:17:39.633 line:93%
I really...

00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:42.833 line:93%
hope you do that.

00:17:44.873 --> 00:17:47.073 line:93%
I want you to keep quiet...

00:17:47.073 --> 00:17:49.143 line:93%
and think for a long, long time...

00:17:49.143 --> 00:17:51.444 line:93%
about the things you did.

00:17:51.444 --> 00:17:53.113 line:93%
One day, you'll realize that...

00:17:56.514 --> 00:17:59.024 line:93%
as much as you've suffered,

00:18:02.823 --> 00:18:04.863 line:93%
you've made others suffer as well.

00:18:21.413 --> 00:18:24.514 line:93%
You go ahead. I have to see a friend.

00:18:24.514 --> 00:18:25.544 line:93%
Okay.

00:18:45.304 --> 00:18:46.534 line:93%
You really got her.

00:18:47.903 --> 00:18:48.934 line:93%
Yes.

00:18:50.173 --> 00:18:51.704 line:93%
We got her together.

00:18:53.343 --> 00:18:54.873 line:93%
What happens now?

00:18:56.244 --> 00:18:57.274 line:93%
Jin Soo A...

00:18:57.274 --> 00:18:59.214 line:93%
will be charged with the murders of Hang Joon, Kim Jong Doo,

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.214 line:93%
and your attempted murder.

00:19:01.853 --> 00:19:03.113 line:93%
She'll go on trial.

00:19:03.214 --> 00:19:04.524 line:93%
And Director Tak?

00:19:04.524 --> 00:19:08.724 line:93%
If she testifies that Tak instigated the murders,

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:11.563 line:93%
he'll never get out.

00:19:11.724 --> 00:19:13.563 line:93%
I think it's all over.

00:19:15.964 --> 00:19:17.264 line:93%
That's great.

00:19:18.133 --> 00:19:20.534 line:93%
Then I can go back now.

00:19:20.934 --> 00:19:22.073 line:93%
Yes.

00:19:25.244 --> 00:19:26.373 line:93%
Then...

00:19:27.274 --> 00:19:28.514 line:93%
I'm off.

00:19:31.913 --> 00:19:33.583 line:93%
Bye, bothersome ghost.

00:19:33.883 --> 00:19:36.784 line:93%
- Don't ignore me when you see me. - You're crazy.

00:19:37.083 --> 00:19:40.224 line:93%
I'm crazy? You're crazier for talking to a ghost.

00:19:50.903 --> 00:19:52.133 line:93%
Goodness.

00:20:03.143 --> 00:20:06.284 line:93%
Gosh. I'm his family, okay?

00:20:06.913 --> 00:20:09.383 line:93%
How can I not see his call records?

00:20:09.383 --> 00:20:10.484 line:93%
The thing is,

00:20:10.754 --> 00:20:13.184 line:93%
- I could get into trouble. - I know that.

00:20:13.554 --> 00:20:18.264 line:93%
You just have to tell me whom he talked to at 6pm.

00:20:18.724 --> 00:20:20.663 line:93%
It's been a while since...

00:20:22.694 --> 00:20:23.994 line:93%
- Hey. - Hey.

00:20:26.133 --> 00:20:28.534 line:93%
Her father was a cop like us.

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:32.004 line:93%
Can't you help us clear a dead man's name?

00:20:35.073 --> 00:20:37.214 line:93%
Okay, okay, fine.

00:20:40.143 --> 00:20:43.454 line:93%
Here's the name and phone number.

00:20:45.353 --> 00:20:47.823 line:93%
- Thank you. - You're so sweet.

00:20:50.393 --> 00:20:52.264 line:93%
You're the best, Detective Park.

00:20:52.264 --> 00:20:54.294 line:93%
I'm not a detective anymore.

00:20:54.593 --> 00:20:55.764 line:93%
Still, thank you.

00:20:55.764 --> 00:20:59.204 line:93%
Detective Cha had asked me to look into...

00:20:59.504 --> 00:21:01.504 line:93%
your father's incident.

00:21:01.504 --> 00:21:03.434 line:93%
- Did he? - Yes.

00:21:07.343 --> 00:21:10.044 line:93%
If I call this Oh Soo Cheol,

00:21:10.413 --> 00:21:11.643 line:93%
I'll find something.

00:21:12.113 --> 00:21:13.113 line:93%
Okay.

00:21:27.393 --> 00:21:28.393 line:93%
Hello?

00:21:28.393 --> 00:21:31.403 line:93%
You gave me something, so now, it's my turn.

00:21:34.504 --> 00:21:36.133 line:93%
16 years ago,

00:21:36.833 --> 00:21:39.444 line:93%
what did you use against Director Tak?

00:21:39.444 --> 00:21:42.143 line:93%
He asked me to make a cop look corrupt.

00:21:42.474 --> 00:21:43.944 line:93%
So I did it.

00:21:45.784 --> 00:21:46.784 line:93%
Was that...

00:21:48.113 --> 00:21:50.014 line:93%
Detective Song Ji Seok?

00:21:51.284 --> 00:21:52.454 line:93%
Yes.

00:21:53.823 --> 00:21:56.123 line:93%
We never met at all,

00:21:56.393 --> 00:21:57.893 line:93%
all right?

00:21:59.393 --> 00:22:04.063 line:93%
If he becomes Minister of Justice, I might have to side with him again.

00:22:05.934 --> 00:22:08.603 line:93%
I hope we never have to meet again.

00:22:14.244 --> 00:22:15.244 line:93%
(Park Dong Ki)

00:22:19.014 --> 00:22:22.214 line:93%
- Hello? - I looked into Song's last day.

00:22:22.554 --> 00:22:24.113 line:93%
Someone remembers him.

00:22:24.423 --> 00:22:26.583 line:93%
A cashier at the cafe he often went to.

00:22:26.984 --> 00:22:30.093 line:93%
She told the detective in charge at the time,

00:22:30.423 --> 00:22:33.224 line:93%
but for some reason, no one followed up.

00:22:34.093 --> 00:22:35.133 line:93%
But...

00:22:35.264 --> 00:22:38.934 line:93%
she remembered the person Detective Song last met.

00:22:39.633 --> 00:22:40.833 line:93%
Who was it?

00:22:41.373 --> 00:22:42.673 line:93%
Tak Jung Hwan.

00:22:42.774 --> 00:22:44.704 line:93%
He was just a prosecutor at the time.

00:22:45.544 --> 00:22:48.143 line:93%
Oh, I was just with Reporter Song.

00:22:48.143 --> 00:22:49.744 line:93%
I didn't tell her this.

00:22:51.684 --> 00:22:52.784 line:93%
I'll tell her.

00:23:03.323 --> 00:23:04.563 line:93%
(Song Ji An)

00:23:11.804 --> 00:23:14.234 line:93%
Reporter Song, it's me. Can we meet up?

00:23:14.234 --> 00:23:16.534 line:93%
Of course, I have something to tell you.

00:23:16.534 --> 00:23:17.873 line:93%
Your coffee's ready.

00:23:18.204 --> 00:23:19.504 line:93%
Thank you.

00:23:31.954 --> 00:23:34.954 line:93%
Hello? Are you Oh Soo Cheol?

00:23:36.454 --> 00:23:39.593 line:93%
Hello, I'm Song Ji An, a reporter with NBC.

00:23:40.294 --> 00:23:43.063 line:93%
Your number came up in an old case.

00:23:43.294 --> 00:23:45.103 line:93%
I wanted to ask you some questions.

00:23:47.934 --> 00:23:49.873 line:93%
I'll go see my father.

00:23:49.873 --> 00:23:50.873 line:93%
Okay.

00:23:50.974 --> 00:23:53.504 line:93%
Sir, this is for you.

00:23:54.143 --> 00:23:57.684 line:93%
They're the photos from 16 years ago that you asked for.

00:24:04.323 --> 00:24:08.724 line:93%
(Cha Dong Tak)

00:24:10.623 --> 00:24:13.163 line:93%
You want to prove that you're a man?

00:24:13.563 --> 00:24:14.794 line:93%
Then follow me.

00:24:18.063 --> 00:24:19.103 line:93%
What?

00:24:22.173 --> 00:24:23.934 line:93%
This is Cha Dong Tak?

00:24:29.843 --> 00:24:32.143 line:93%
Tak Jung Hwan who framed my innocent dad,

00:24:32.284 --> 00:24:35.754 line:93%
and the helmet girl who killed Jo Hang Joon.

00:24:38.153 --> 00:24:39.754 line:93%
We got them all.

00:24:42.623 --> 00:24:44.623 line:93%
What kind of fate is this dramatic?

00:24:45.194 --> 00:24:47.063 line:93%
Just two days before my time is up,

00:24:48.093 --> 00:24:49.663 line:93%
I can go back to my body.

00:24:50.694 --> 00:24:51.764 line:93%
It's such a relief.

00:24:52.603 --> 00:24:54.903 line:93%
I can go back and come to life.

00:24:56.004 --> 00:24:57.004 line:93%
Okay.

00:24:58.673 --> 00:24:59.843 line:93%
Here goes.

00:25:15.093 --> 00:25:16.353 line:93%
The hospital smell.

00:25:17.663 --> 00:25:18.663 line:93%
Nice.

00:25:20.623 --> 00:25:22.163 line:93%
Why am I in the same clothes...

00:25:22.563 --> 00:25:23.734 line:93%
as before?

00:25:28.133 --> 00:25:31.444 line:93%
Why... I'm still in bed.

00:25:32.504 --> 00:25:33.774 line:93%
What's wrong?

00:25:34.573 --> 00:25:36.113 line:93%
I'll try again.

00:25:42.784 --> 00:25:44.113 line:93%
Why not?

00:25:44.724 --> 00:25:46.383 line:93%
Why won't it work?

00:25:47.423 --> 00:25:49.454 line:93%
Why can't I go back?

00:25:51.863 --> 00:25:52.964 line:93%
Cha Dong Tak.

00:25:53.593 --> 00:25:55.234 line:93%
Something's wrong.

00:25:56.294 --> 00:25:58.764 line:93%
Is there something else left to solve?

00:26:09.643 --> 00:26:11.184 line:93%
Is my dad here?

00:26:12.244 --> 00:26:13.843 line:93%
I can tell him if you want.

00:26:17.413 --> 00:26:19.653 line:93%
"You shouldn't forget the cause..."

00:26:21.554 --> 00:26:23.224 line:93%
"of the traffic accident 16 years ago."

00:26:24.524 --> 00:26:26.024 line:93%
"Do not forget that."

00:26:30.333 --> 00:26:31.734 line:93%
Was that what you said?

00:26:33.734 --> 00:26:34.774 line:93%
What if...

00:26:37.304 --> 00:26:39.143 line:93%
it all started because of someone?

00:26:41.514 --> 00:26:42.714 line:93%
Who?

00:26:43.444 --> 00:26:44.613 line:93%
Don't you remember?

00:26:46.544 --> 00:26:47.554 line:93%
"Hey,"

00:26:48.784 --> 00:26:50.083 line:93%
"nerd."

00:26:59.163 --> 00:27:00.323 line:93%
Hey, nerd.

00:27:01.093 --> 00:27:02.764 line:93%
Is this your dad's car?

00:27:02.964 --> 00:27:06.504 line:93%
I thought you were a nerd, but you're actually a girl.

00:27:06.863 --> 00:27:08.004 line:93%
What?

00:27:08.133 --> 00:27:10.333 line:93%
You want to prove that...

00:27:10.704 --> 00:27:12.004 line:93%
you're a man?

00:27:12.343 --> 00:27:13.573 line:93%
Then follow me.

00:27:32.224 --> 00:27:33.994 line:93%
What's that?

00:27:46.044 --> 00:27:47.244 line:93%
Now, do you remember?

00:27:49.143 --> 00:27:50.143 line:93%
(Couple Dies)

00:27:51.813 --> 00:27:53.514 line:93%
Dad.

00:27:55.454 --> 00:27:56.784 line:93%
Will you open?

00:28:09.464 --> 00:28:10.633 line:93%
Then it was...

00:28:10.633 --> 00:28:12.063 line:93%
Yes, it was your fault.

00:28:13.434 --> 00:28:14.833 line:93%
That day, 16 years ago,

00:28:15.504 --> 00:28:16.974 line:93%
the accident happened...

00:28:19.343 --> 00:28:20.804 line:93%
because of you.

00:28:24.984 --> 00:28:26.014 line:93%
What...

00:28:26.714 --> 00:28:27.913 line:93%
does he mean?

00:28:29.353 --> 00:28:32.353 line:93%
All this began with me.

00:28:36.554 --> 00:28:38.764 line:93%
I didn't use my phone that day.

00:28:38.863 --> 00:28:40.623 line:93%
My nephew stole it.

00:28:40.623 --> 00:28:43.234 line:93%
If you want to know more, you can ask him.

00:28:43.234 --> 00:28:45.633 line:93%
He's a detective in Seoul Central Police Station.

00:28:45.633 --> 00:28:46.863 line:93%
His name is Cha Dong Tak.

00:28:47.573 --> 00:28:50.204 line:93%
The one who called my dad that day was...

00:28:50.774 --> 00:28:52.544 line:93%
Detective Cha?

00:28:54.173 --> 00:28:57.444 line:93%
Well, they were acquainted, so it's a possibility.

00:28:59.244 --> 00:29:02.054 line:93%
Then that means my dad suddenly had to do something...

00:29:02.853 --> 00:29:05.423 line:93%
after he got a call from Detective Cha.

00:29:05.724 --> 00:29:07.853 line:93%
Even Ji An's misfortune.

00:29:08.954 --> 00:29:11.923 line:93%
Will I ever have the nerve to say this to you?

00:29:12.194 --> 00:29:13.863 line:93%
That's all I have to say.

00:29:14.694 --> 00:29:16.363 line:93%
I'm going to go see my father.

00:29:25.744 --> 00:29:27.444 line:93%
Did he just say it's all because of you?

00:29:29.544 --> 00:29:30.883 line:93%
What does that mean?

00:29:32.184 --> 00:29:33.284 line:93%
Tell me.

00:29:34.583 --> 00:29:36.083 line:93%
What does he mean?

00:29:43.393 --> 00:29:44.524 line:93%
And...

00:29:45.093 --> 00:29:46.863 line:93%
to you, Soo Chang.

00:30:26.464 --> 00:30:28.103 line:93%
(Two Cops)

00:30:28.504 --> 00:30:30.804 line:93%
He was actually the guy who ruined my life.

00:30:30.903 --> 00:30:32.873 line:93%
Why is life so harsh?

00:30:32.873 --> 00:30:34.873 line:93%
You killed Detective Jo according to...

00:30:34.873 --> 00:30:36.514 line:93%
Director Tak's order, right?

00:30:36.514 --> 00:30:38.984 line:93%
Whom are you trying to blame for abetting murder?

00:30:38.984 --> 00:30:41.954 line:93%
He was actually murdered by Director Tak Jung Hwan.

00:30:42.054 --> 00:30:44.554 line:93%
Have you ever wondered why...

00:30:44.554 --> 00:30:46.623 line:93%
you had to do the killing?

00:30:46.623 --> 00:30:49.853 line:93%
You have to finish the whole thing.

00:30:50.054 --> 00:30:51.893 line:93%
Then what about Dong Tak?
