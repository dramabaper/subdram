(Hidden Crime Team)

00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:22.378 line:93%
Relax.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.629 line:93%
I'm not here to fight.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.969 line:93%
You'll regret it
if you keep on being so mad.

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.169 line:93%
If you're not here to turn
yourself in for killing Ddak Ji,

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.579 line:93%
get out.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.280 line:93%
Really?

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:44.579 line:93%
Should I really go?

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.189 line:93%
I...

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.850 line:93%
came to file a report.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.490 line:93%
The real culprit...

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:57.490 line:93%
behind the Odong Blowfish House case
from 10 years ago.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.369 line:93%
(Episode 29)

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.460 line:93%
I feel very sorry to trouble...

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.089 line:93%
the daughter of Chairman Jin
and make her clear my table.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.999 line:93%
Why did you call me back?

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.999 line:93%
Since we got caught
by Inspector Park,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.169 line:93%
I know that our deal is off.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.240 line:93%
Yes, the deal is off.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.410 line:93%
But it's because we found
the autopsy report,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.609 line:93%
not because of Inspector Park.

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.509 line:93%
You guys are so lucky.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.050 line:93%
It must've been difficult
to find it.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.809 line:93%
We're just good.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.050 line:93%
And you're going down.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.990 line:93%
We found the evidence,

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.720 line:93%
so Lee Kwang Ho must've
gotten furious.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.630 line:93%
Now we can re-investigate
Odong Blowfish House murder case.

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:06.729 line:93%
Is that so?

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.470 line:93%
I don't care about that.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.410 line:93%
I guess you're thirsty.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.509 line:93%
Do you want some water?

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.380 line:93%
Not only will you clear my table,
but you'll also bring me water?

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.609 line:93%
Sure. I should drink water
after a meal.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.850 line:93%
Please bring me water...

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.790 line:93%
in a bottle, not from a dispenser.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.320 line:93%
A bottle of water,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.389 line:93%
please.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.040 line:93%
Lieutenant Jin.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.669 line:93%
Officer Kwon. Where is Sergeant Kim?

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.239 line:93%
He's at
the National Forensic Service...

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.870 line:93%
with Inspector Park for an autopsy.

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:52.679 line:93%
Good work.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.709 line:93%
Wait. You aren't busy, are you?

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.780 line:93%
No.

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.280 line:93%
Then let's get Jang Pil Sung's
statement together.

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.889 line:93%
You go ahead first.
I need to get a drink.

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:02.889 line:93%
Okay.

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.000 line:93%
You didn't poison it, did you?

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.639 line:93%
You'll find out, won't you?

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.519 line:93%
How much of it should I believe?

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.720 line:93%
It's too bad
if you don't believe me.

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.090 line:93%
What's the reason?
Why all of a sudden?

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.989 line:93%
Officer Oh, hurry.
It's an emergency.

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.190 line:93%
Come with me. Hurry.

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:01.650 line:93%
I killed him.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.060 line:93%
Yes. This is
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.020 line:93%
Aren't we there yet?
We should've arrived there by now.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.290 line:93%
We should've.

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:22.729 line:93%
What happened?

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:24.929 line:93%
Did this happen
after he drank water?

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:26.359 line:93%
Yes.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.530 line:93%
You should calm her down.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.069 line:93%
This is a crime scene,
so you can't be here.

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.510 line:93%
Let's go.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.410 line:93%
Goodness.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.040 line:93%
Jin Young.

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:11.979 line:93%
Jin Jin Young.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.609 line:93%
That water bottle,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.419 line:93%
did you bring it to him?

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:22.189 line:93%
Are you sure?

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.090 line:93%
Yes.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.319 line:93%
I got it from a vending machine...

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.160 line:93%
Excuse me!

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.309 line:93%
Then that man could've
switched the bottles.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.210 line:93%
He couldn't have.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.879 line:93%
He's a part-timer at the cafe.

00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:50.109 line:93%
A part-timer?

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:54.989 line:93%
Let's go.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.150 line:93%
Are you okay?

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:37.229 line:93%
(To report a crime, call 112.)

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:49.910 line:93%
What happened?

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.280 line:93%
What's this? What's going on?

00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:02.590 line:93%
So you bumped into that part-timer
and dropped the water bottle.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.650 line:93%
Is that all?

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:05.419 line:93%
Yes.

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:07.760 line:93%
Did you see the man's face
who attacked you?

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.830 line:93%
No.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.559 line:93%
- Inspector Park.
- Yes.

00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:15.929 line:93%
I think he looks like him.

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:17.100 line:93%
Hurry up.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.169 line:93%
- Plug it in.
- Okay.

00:08:26.609 --> 00:08:29.780 line:93%
His physique and movement
look like the part-timer's.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.249 line:93%
But we can't see his face,
so we can't pin him.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:37.150 line:93%
If that really was the part-timer,
that'd be shocking.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.160 line:93%
He's been working at the cafe
for a long time.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.959 line:93%
I can't believe
he's on Lee Kwang Ho's side.

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:45.699 line:93%
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:46.760 line:93%
It's okay, sir.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.069 line:93%
No, go after work.

00:08:49.069 --> 00:08:50.130 line:93%
No, it's okay.

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:53.000 line:93%
And that jerk,

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:56.270 line:93%
I'm going to catch that guy
no matter what.

00:08:56.709 --> 00:08:59.540 line:93%
Of course. He undermined
the governmental authority.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.549 line:93%
You should have
your wife and Kang...

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.549 line:93%
- under protection.
- I already put in a request.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.919 line:93%
To whom?

00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:12.059 line:93%
What's going on?

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.829 line:93%
It's nothing.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.000 line:93%
Then why
in the middle of the night...

00:09:18.199 --> 00:09:20.360 line:93%
Did something bad happen?

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:22.599 line:93%
Are we in danger?

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.799 line:93%
No.

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:27.270 line:93%
Just in case.
It's just a precaution.

00:09:28.169 --> 00:09:29.939 line:93%
I came because
they're short of hands.

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:33.410 line:93%
Su Chil will explain everything
when we get to the agency.

00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:36.150 line:93%
Don't worry about it
until we get there.

00:09:42.689 --> 00:09:45.219 line:93%
Are you sure Jang Pil Sung died?

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.459 line:93%
Yes. He became paralyzed
right after he drank water.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.360 line:93%
When I checked,
he stopped breathing.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.199 line:93%
It's strange. They should've left
the body there if he was dead.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.699 line:93%
Why did they take the corpse...

00:09:57.699 --> 00:09:59.969 line:93%
when it was a perfect chance
to frame you?

00:10:00.469 --> 00:10:01.939 line:93%
I'm asking myself the same question.

00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:04.480 line:93%
Maybe Gook Su Ran came here
because...

00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:06.480 line:93%
Was she here?

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.480 line:93%
Yes.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.309 line:93%
Hey.

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.020 line:93%
We were just about to go see you.

00:10:13.449 --> 00:10:17.020 line:93%
Are you shocked after finding out
the results?

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.360 line:93%
Yes, kind of.

00:10:18.589 --> 00:10:20.990 line:93%
By the way, what was it
that Jang Pil Sung drank?

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.530 line:93%
It's something similar to
potassium cyanide.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.000 line:93%
It paralyzes your muscles as soon as
you drink it.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.169 line:93%
That's what it does to you.

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:31.040 line:93%
It even paralyzes the muscles in
your respiratory system.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.199 line:93%
And that's why he couldn't breathe.

00:10:34.839 --> 00:10:37.469 line:93%
I also found some small,

00:10:37.469 --> 00:10:40.740 line:93%
needle-sized holes on the bottle.

00:10:41.209 --> 00:10:44.150 line:93%
That means the chemical was inserted
from outside.

00:10:44.219 --> 00:10:47.150 line:93%
I guess that means Jang Pil Sung
is dead.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.250 line:93%
I guess so. But it's so weird.

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:51.760 line:93%
Lieutenant Jin.

00:10:52.459 --> 00:10:54.059 line:93%
You don't know anything about this,
do you?

00:10:54.929 --> 00:10:56.790 line:93%
- No.
- I'm sure you don't.

00:10:57.459 --> 00:11:00.500 line:93%
I've been working with you
for years now.

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.000 line:93%
So I'm sure...

00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:05.000 line:93%
you didn't know anything about this.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.199 line:93%
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.709 line:93%
Well, the concentration
of the chemical...

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.410 line:93%
wasn't exactly enough to kill him.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.910 line:93%
Of course, this may differ according
to each person.

00:11:17.049 --> 00:11:20.319 line:93%
But judging from his weight,

00:11:20.319 --> 00:11:23.819 line:93%
that amount is just enough to
allow him to breathe...

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.189 line:93%
even if his whole body is paralyzed.

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:28.689 line:93%
And if he's given an antidote,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.000 line:93%
he might also be able to live.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.870 line:93%
Are you saying he might not
be dead right now?

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.400 line:93%
The entire ambulance went missing.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.839 line:93%
I guess that means they were trying
to save him and take him away.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.339 line:93%
Who in the world would do that?

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.980 line:93%
- How did it go?
- We got him out safely.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.790 line:93%
He's quickly getting better.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.219 line:93%
But why did you suddenly
change the plan?

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:02.189 line:93%
I heard Manager Lee gave orders
to kill him.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.429 line:93%
The situation has changed.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.030 line:93%
Where is Jang Pil Sung right now?

00:12:33.059 --> 00:12:34.429 line:93%
How do you feel?

00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:37.599 line:93%
What do you think you're doing?

00:12:37.599 --> 00:12:39.760 line:93%
What do you think? I just saved you.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:44.439 line:93%
Manager Lee...

00:12:44.439 --> 00:12:47.000 line:93%
just gave orders for
Jang Pil Sung to be killed.

00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:48.939 line:93%
So?

00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:51.280 line:93%
I think the Backup Team
will be on it.

00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:53.309 line:93%
Call them for me.

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:55.679 line:93%
Okay.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:03.120 line:93%
It's Gook Su Ran.

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:05.990 line:93%
There's been a change of plans.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.530 line:93%
You were really close to dying,
but you must not be that grateful.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.299 line:93%
You were supposed to get me out
by law, not by force.

00:13:16.669 --> 00:13:17.799 line:93%
Do you expect me...

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.309 line:93%
to stay hidden until I die?

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.780 line:93%
What's important right now is for
you to at least stay alive.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.510 line:93%
I'm not even sure if this
is going to help me stay alive.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.449 line:93%
If you went against Manager Lee's
orders in order to save me,

00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:35.089 line:93%
I'll end up dying one day
even if I'm still alive.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.990 line:93%
He'll kill me easily.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.059 line:93%
That's why...

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.059 line:93%
you need to choose.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.329 line:93%
Are you asking me to...

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:49.230 line:93%
betray Manger Lee?

00:13:50.969 --> 00:13:52.000 line:93%
Yes.

00:13:55.339 --> 00:13:56.669 line:93%
Do you even have a weapon?

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.780 line:93%
I'll only...

00:13:59.709 --> 00:14:04.010 line:93%
be able to tell you once you decide
who you're going to side with.

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:09.319 line:93%
Even if you decide not to
side with me,

00:14:09.319 --> 00:14:11.459 line:93%
I won't be cheap enough...

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.490 line:93%
to tell the cops that you're here.

00:14:15.329 --> 00:14:16.730 line:93%
So you can decide comfortably.

00:14:20.754 --> 00:14:25.754 line:93%
<font color="#80ffff">[Kocowa Ver] E29 Doubtful Victory "I'm Here to File a Report"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.410 line:93%
What do you want from me?

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:33.709 line:93%
Odong Blowfish House.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.049 line:93%
You were in charge of that case.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.079 line:93%
So I'm sure you have other documents
other than the autopsy record.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.890 line:93%
Have you come to a decision?

00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:50.900 line:93%
There's no need to choose.

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:56.199 line:93%
You saved my life when
Manager Lee tried to kill me.

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:01.510 line:93%
How much does Manager Lee know?

00:15:02.339 --> 00:15:03.339 line:93%
What do you mean?

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.579 line:93%
I'm asking if he knows that
you saved me.

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:10.780 line:93%
Whom did she save?

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.480 line:93%
I'm sorry, sir.

00:15:13.849 --> 00:15:15.120 line:93%
Are you sure?

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.919 line:93%
- Did she really save Jang Pil Sung?
- Yes, sir.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.929 line:93%
The whole plan was carried out
by her men.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.459 line:93%
So the only person who had the
authority to change the plan...

00:15:24.929 --> 00:15:26.400 line:93%
was Chairwoman Gook.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.429 line:93%
- Where is she right now?
- I can't get a hold of her.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.640 line:93%
She must have some kind of
secret plan.

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:37.709 line:93%
She'll be here soon to
either make a deal...

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.939 line:93%
or to threaten me.

00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:41.650 line:93%
Why do you think
she's being like this?

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:44.579 line:93%
Do you think it's because of
Young Min?

00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:46.949 line:93%
We'll be able to find out soon.

00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:49.120 line:93%
Don't you think you're being
too laid back right now?

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.860 line:93%
If she turns on you,

00:15:52.589 --> 00:15:54.490 line:93%
she might become your biggest enemy.

00:15:56.459 --> 00:15:58.299 line:93%
Do you think I don't know that?

00:15:59.599 --> 00:16:00.760 line:93%
I'm sorry.

00:16:02.199 --> 00:16:03.599 line:93%
What is the police doing?

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.069 line:93%
They're trying hard to find him,
but I'm sure it's going to be hard.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.480 line:93%
I really don't know
much about him...

00:16:16.579 --> 00:16:18.780 line:93%
apart from him name
and phone number.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.719 line:93%
He was always quiet, and he
never really talked about himself.

00:16:22.719 --> 00:16:26.319 line:93%
And I never asked because I figured
he might not want to talk about it.

00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:31.500 line:93%
Was that part-timer's name
Lee Kyung Jae?

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:33.000 line:93%
Yes.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.730 line:93%
But that won't be enough
to find him, right?

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:36.730 line:93%
No.

00:16:37.469 --> 00:16:38.939 line:93%
Because it's all fake.

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:42.040 line:93%
Remember the resume he handed in?

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.679 line:93%
Everything starting from his school
and address are all fake.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.280 line:93%
His cell phone was also
a cloned phone.

00:16:48.349 --> 00:16:52.520 line:93%
Have you ever noticed anything...

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.589 line:93%
weird about him?

00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:57.049 line:93%
No.

00:16:57.319 --> 00:17:00.819 line:93%
He was a really diligent worker,
and he was never late.

00:17:01.089 --> 00:17:02.089 line:93%
I see.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.429 line:93%
Did he do something...

00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:07.500 line:93%
really bad?

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.130 line:93%
Yes.

00:17:09.699 --> 00:17:12.470 line:93%
I'll tell you specifically
in detail next time.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.579 line:93%
Where's Chul Gi?

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.879 line:93%
He left as soon as he dropped us off
saying that he had to go somewhere.

00:17:21.879 --> 00:17:22.950 line:93%
I see.

00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:34.490 line:93%
Are you crazy?

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.290 line:93%
How could you plant a mole
near Cha Kyung?

00:17:38.159 --> 00:17:40.230 line:93%
Didn't you already know that...

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:42.569 line:93%
we take care of things
very meticulously?

00:17:43.869 --> 00:17:45.670 line:93%
That's why you couldn't disobey us.

00:17:48.339 --> 00:17:49.409 line:93%
So...

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.980 line:93%
who else is there?

00:17:54.609 --> 00:17:56.409 line:93%
Who else do you have near her?

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.319 line:93%
There's no one else.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.750 line:93%
Really?

00:18:01.649 --> 00:18:02.920 line:93%
Do you expect me to believe that?

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.530 line:93%
Until when are you going to do this?

00:18:11.159 --> 00:18:13.799 line:93%
You guys have nothing to do
with me anymore!

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.639 line:93%
You must not get what's
going on right now.

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:19.970 line:93%
Things aren't quite the same.

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:24.839 line:93%
You and I aren't enemies anymore.

00:18:25.109 --> 00:18:26.480 line:93%
What are you talking about?

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.280 line:93%
I guess you haven't
heard about it yet.

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:33.379 line:93%
I went to Kim Jong Sam earlier
and told him...

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.119 line:93%
something really important.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.670 line:93%
Are you okay?

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.569 line:93%
Yes.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.170 line:93%
Kind of.

00:19:05.049 --> 00:19:06.079 line:93%
What were you doing?

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.220 line:93%
I need to go home for a while.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.819 line:93%
By the way, Chul Gi called.
I think he found something out.

00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:14.930 line:93%
He said everything will be fine.
I'll be right back.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.960 line:93%
I know you're busy.
You can keep working.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.000 line:93%
- No, it's okay.
- Bye.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.599 line:93%
- Come on.
- Bye.

00:19:24.839 --> 00:19:26.440 line:93%
We should go home too.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.940 line:93%
When are you going to tell me?

00:19:29.639 --> 00:19:31.579 line:93%
- What do you mean?
- Why did...

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.680 line:93%
Gook Su Ran come?

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.210 line:93%
I'll tell you tomorrow.

00:19:38.349 --> 00:19:39.450 line:93%
You need to rest first.

00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:42.089 line:93%
Let's go.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.829 line:93%
Why did you call instead of
coming inside?

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.099 line:93%
Hey, what's going on?

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:01.270 line:93%
What did you hear from Gook Su Ran?

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.839 line:93%
I guess you met her.

00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:05.309 line:93%
I heard she told you about the
Odong Blowfish House case.

00:20:06.139 --> 00:20:07.180 line:93%
I...

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.879 line:93%
came to file a report.

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:11.379 line:93%
(Odong Blowfish House)

00:20:11.379 --> 00:20:12.649 line:93%
The real culprit...

00:20:12.649 --> 00:20:15.490 line:93%
behind the Odong Blowfish House case
from 10 years ago.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.099 line:93%
Who are you?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.069 line:93%
You are Gook Su Ran, aren't you?

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.839 line:93%
I'm Prosecutor Joo Sung Woo.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.040 line:93%
Mr. Lee is in there, isn't he?

00:21:07.569 --> 00:21:10.339 line:93%
You came to the wrong place.
There is nobody by that name.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.879 line:93%
Someone up there likes me.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.849 line:93%
So this is
where he enters and exits.

00:21:18.849 --> 00:21:21.549 line:93%
I was hoping to meet with Mr. Lee,

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:24.119 line:93%
so I had been waiting
in front of the restaurant.

00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:26.190 line:93%
Then I had to pee.

00:21:26.859 --> 00:21:29.430 line:93%
So I came around the back.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.730 line:93%
And I saw you, Mr. Lee's right arm,
open this door.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.329 line:93%
Do not worry. I'm...

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.940 line:93%
a huge supporter of Mr. Lee.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.480 line:93%
Also my father-in-law is...

00:21:50.579 --> 00:21:52.950 line:93%
I came here to ask him a favor
in person.

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:57.450 line:93%
I'd like to request
a district attorney position.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.460 line:93%
It seems like
you heard a rumor that isn't true.

00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:02.460 line:93%
There is no Mr. Lee here.
You should leave.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.659 line:93%
Come on. You can't just
take my money and ignore me.

00:22:08.629 --> 00:22:12.770 line:93%
You've used a lot of
my father-in-law's money.

00:22:13.299 --> 00:22:14.639 line:93%
But you never answered.

00:22:15.569 --> 00:22:18.379 line:93%
So I waited all this time
on this cold day.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.879 line:93%
You've got the wrong place.
Please leave...

00:22:36.629 --> 00:22:37.659 line:93%
Sir.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.869 line:93%
I don't think
I need to ask him a favor.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.240 line:93%
Don't worry. I didn't see anything.

00:22:53.639 --> 00:22:55.450 line:93%
My service to you, Mr. Lee.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.000 line:93%
How much should I believe?

00:23:14.099 --> 00:23:18.099 line:93%
I'm not sure.
The story is very detailed.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.770 line:93%
Anyway, if her story is true,

00:23:20.869 --> 00:23:24.409 line:93%
that means Gook Su Ran
turned against Lee Kwang Ho.

00:23:25.109 --> 00:23:28.409 line:93%
I think she did.
That's why she took Jang Pil Sung,

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.280 line:93%
so they can betray
Lee Kwang Ho together.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:32.950 line:93%
Why all of a sudden?

00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:35.649 line:93%
Why did she turn against him?

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.319 line:93%
Be straightforward with me.

00:23:41.089 --> 00:23:42.730 line:93%
Why did you save Jang Pil Sung?

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.129 line:93%
You tell me first.

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:48.200 line:93%
Where is Young Min?

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.099 line:93%
Where? He's getting interrogated.

00:23:50.099 --> 00:23:51.369 line:93%
Not that Young Min.

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:54.540 line:93%
The one you adopted publicly.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.639 line:93%
Are you...

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.109 line:93%
Young Min's mother?

00:24:05.649 --> 00:24:06.680 line:93%
Yes.

00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:13.260 line:93%
Now that I think about it,
it was easy to notice.

00:24:13.889 --> 00:24:15.690 line:93%
I just thought...

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.099 line:93%
you were good to Young Min
because of your loyalty to me.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.030 line:93%
I guess I trusted you too much.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.629 line:93%
I guess I trusted you too much
as well.

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:29.339 line:93%
For a long time,
I thought you would...

00:24:29.869 --> 00:24:32.139 line:93%
view him favorably someday.

00:24:34.879 --> 00:24:35.950 line:93%
So...

00:24:36.879 --> 00:24:39.049 line:93%
where is the real Young Min?

00:24:39.619 --> 00:24:40.649 line:93%
He's dead.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.359 line:93%
Did he die,

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.059 line:93%
or did you kill him?

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.930 line:93%
He died. It was an accident.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.270 line:93%
Okay.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:02.470 line:93%
Daddy.

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:29.369 line:93%
Will you ruin your life
because of a son...

00:25:29.369 --> 00:25:31.099 line:93%
you didn't even raise yourself?

00:25:35.639 --> 00:25:36.710 line:93%
Come in.

00:25:51.889 --> 00:25:54.659 line:93%
Did you suggest investigating
the Odong Blowfish House case?

00:26:00.359 --> 00:26:02.629 line:93%
I have nothing on
the Odong Blowfish House...

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:04.129 line:93%
except for the autopsy report.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.569 line:93%
But I have some evidence of
Chairwoman Gook instigating murder.

00:26:13.309 --> 00:26:15.309 line:93%
Recent cases are...

00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:17.720 line:93%
Mr. Choi...

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.619 line:93%
and Baek Kyung.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.319 line:93%
It's your turn to decide.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.930 line:93%
Will you continue stabbing me
in the back,

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.260 line:93%
or will you behave yourself,
and keep quiet?

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.740 line:93%
So who else knows about
Gook Su Ran's story?

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.740 line:93%
No one knows yet.

00:26:44.339 --> 00:26:46.480 line:93%
I'll tell people
when I'm sure of it.

00:26:49.079 --> 00:26:52.020 line:93%
Your real identity could be
discovered.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.490 line:93%
That would be a problem,
but I also feel uncomfortable...

00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:59.559 line:93%
lying to Inspector Park
about who I really am.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.760 line:93%
Lie about what?

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.760 line:93%
I mean, Jang Pil Sung.

00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:07.099 line:93%
I think we were tricked.

00:27:08.329 --> 00:27:09.430 line:93%
How?

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.000 line:93%
I think Gook Su Ran took him.

00:27:12.099 --> 00:27:16.069 line:93%
That's why you took Jang Pil Sung.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.440 line:93%
The more the better.

00:27:18.639 --> 00:27:20.109 line:93%
Lee Kwang Ho's enemies.

00:27:20.809 --> 00:27:23.210 line:93%
Gosh, some nerve.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.079 line:93%
Should we go after Gook Su Ran then?

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.649 line:93%
That won't do any good.

00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:28.849 line:93%
You won't be able to find her
any time soon anyway.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.290 line:93%
Gook Su Ran. Jang Pil Sung.

00:27:35.089 --> 00:27:36.859 line:93%
Both aren't easy opponents.

00:28:42.983 --> 00:28:46.583 line:93%
(Episode 30 will air shortly.)
